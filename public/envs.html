<p class="para">We could answer the question ‘What is ecology?’ by examining various definitions that have been proposed and choosing one as the best (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fea-0001">Box 1.1</a>). But while definitions have conciseness and precision, and they are good at preparing you for an examination, they are not so good at capturing the flavor and excitement of ecology. There is a lot to be gained by replacing that single question about a definition with a series of more provocative ones: ‘What do ecologists <span class="txt-italic">do</span>?’ ‘What are ecologists <span class="txt-italic">interested</span> in?’ and ‘Where did ecology emerge from in the first place?’</p>

<div class="box">
<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">Definitions of Ecology</h5>
<p class="para">Ecology (originally in German, <span class="txt-italic">Öekologie</span>) was first defined in 1866 by Ernst Haeckel, an enthusiastic and influential disciple of Charles Darwin. To him, ecology was ‘the comprehensive science of the relationship of the organism to the environment.’ The spirit of this definition is very clear in an early discussion of biological subdisciplines by Burdon-Sanderson (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0079">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0079</a>-->1893), in which ecology is ‘the science which concerns itself with the external relations of plants and animals to each other and to the past and present conditions of their existence,’ to be contrasted with physiology (internal relations) and morphology (structure).</p>
<p class="para indent">In the years after Haeckel, plant ecology and animal ecology drifted apart. Influential works defined ecology as ‘those relations of <span class="txt-italic">plants</span>, with their surroundings and with one another, which depend directly upon differences of habitat among plants’ (Tansley, 1904<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0573">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0573</a>-->), or as the science ‘chiefly concerned with what may be called the sociology and economics of <span class="txt-italic">animals</span>, rather than with the structural and other adaptations possessed by them’ (Elton, 1927<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0157">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0157</a>-->). The plant ecologists and animal ecologist, though, have long since agreed that they belong together, and more recent definitions of ecology include all organisms, including bacteria, archaea, algae, and fungi in addition to plants and animals. Most modern definitions stress the relationships between and among organisms. For example, two textbooks from the 1970s defined ecology as ‘the study of the natural environment, particularly the interrelationships between organisms and their surroundings’ (Ricklefs, 1973<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0489">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0489</a>-->) and as ‘the scientific study of the <span class="txt-italic">interactions</span> that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms’ (Krebs, 1972<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0329">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0329</a>-->).</p>
<p class="para indent">Ecology certainly includes the investigation of organisms and their interactions, but to many ecologists, definitions that focus only on these interactions and on the distribution and abundance of organisms are too narrow. Ecologists also examine the interaction between life and the physical environment, for instance studying how organisms affect material fluxes in nature. The sequestration of carbon dioxide by a forest would be one example of this. Beginning in the mid-20th century, the American ecologist E. P. Odum (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0439">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0439</a>-->1953) pushed for a broader definition of ecology: ‘the study of the structure and function of nature, which includes the living world.’ Many have thought this definition overly broad, as geologists and meteorologists also study aspects of the structure and function of nature. In 1992, G. E. Likens stressed the need for the definition of ecology to include ‘the interactions between organisms and the transformation and flux of energy and matter.’ We agree, and in this text define ecology as:</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms, the interactions that determine that distribution and abundance, and the relationships between organisms and the transformation and flux of energy and matter.</span></p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Ecology can lay claim to being the oldest science, as the most primitive humans must have been ecologists of sorts, driven by the need to understand where and when their food and their (nonhuman) enemies were to be found. The earliest agriculturalists needed to be even more sophisticated, with knowledge of how to manage their domesticated sources of food. These early ecologists, then, were <span class="txt-italic">applied</span> ecologists, seeking to understand the distribution, abundance, and productivity of organisms in order to apply that knowledge for their own benefit. Applied ecologists today still have many of the same interests: how to optimize the rate at which food is collected from natural environments in a sustainable way; how domesticated plants and animals can best be managed so as to maximize rates of return; how food organisms can be protected from their own natural enemies; and how to control the populations of pathogens and parasites that live on us.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In the last century or so, however, since ecologists have been self-conscious enough to give themselves a name, ecology has consistently covered not only applied but also fundamental, ‘pure’ science. A.G. Tansley was one of the founding fathers of ecology. He was concerned especially to understand, for understanding’s sake, the processes responsible for determining the structure and composition of different plant communities. When, in 1904, he wrote from Britain about ‘The problems of ecology’ he was particularly worried by a tendency for too much ecology to remain at the descriptive and unsystematic stage (such as accumulating descriptions of communities without knowing whether they were typical, temporary, or whatever), too rarely moving on to experimental or systematically planned, or what we might call a <span class="txt-italic">scientific</span> analysis.</p>


<p class="para indent">Tansley’s worries were echoed in the United States by another of ecology’s founders, F. E. Clements, who in 1905 in his <span class="txt-italic">Research Methods in Ecology</span> complained:</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote">The bane of the recent development popularly known as ecology has been a widespread feeling that anyone can do ecological work, regardless of preparation. There is nothing … more erroneous than this feeling.</p>
<p class="para indent">On the other hand, the need for <span class="txt-italic">applied</span> ecology to be based on its <span class="txt-italic">pure</span> counterpart was clear in the introduction to Charles Elton’s (1927) <span class="txt-italic">Animal Ecology</span> (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0001">Figure 1.1</a>):</p>

<p class="para indent">In the intervening years, the coexistence of these pure and applied threads has been maintained and built upon. Many applied sciences such as forestry, agronomy, and fisheries biology have contributed to the development of ecology and have seen their own development enhanced by ecological ideas and approaches. All aspects of food and fiber gathering, production, and protection have been involved. The biological control of pests (the use of pests’ natural enemies to control them) has a history going back at least to the ancient Chinese but has seen a resurgence of ecological interest since the shortcomings of chemical pesticides began to be widely apparent in the 1950s. The ecology of pollution has been a growing concern from around the same time and expanded further in the 1980s and 1990s from local to regional and global issues. The last few decades have also seen expansions in both public interest and ecological input into the conservation of endangered species and the biodiversity of whole areas, the control of disease in humans as well as many other species, and the potential consequences of profound human-caused changes to the global environment.</p>

<p class="para">unanswered questions</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">And yet, at the same time, many fundamental problems of ecology remain unanswered. To what extent does competition for food determine which species can coexist in a habitat? What role does disease play in the dynamics of populations? Why are there more species in the tropics than at the poles? What is the relationship between soil productivity and plant community structure? Why are some species more vulnerable to extinction than others? Are wetlands net sources or sinks of greenhouse gas emission to the atmosphere? And so on. Of course, unanswered questions—if they are <span class="txt-italic">focused</span> questions—are a symptom of the health, not the weakness, of any science. But ecology is not an easy science, and it has particular subtlety and complexity, in part because ecology is peculiarly confronted by ‘uniqueness’: millions of different species, countless billions of genetically distinct individuals, all living and interacting in a varied and ever-changing world. The beauty of ecology is that it challenges us to develop an understanding of very basic and apparent problems—in a way that recognizes the uniqueness and complexity of all aspects of nature – but seeks patterns and predictions within this complexity rather than being swamped by it.</p>

<p class="para indent">Let’s come back to the question of what ecologists do. First and foremost ecology is a science, and ecologists therefore try to <span class="txt-italic">explain</span> and <span class="txt-italic">understand</span>. Explanation can be either ‘proximate’ or ‘ultimate,’ and ecologists are interested in both. For example, the present distribution and abundance of a particular species of bird may be ‘explained’ in terms of the physical environment that the bird tolerates, the food that it eats, and the parasites and predators that attack it. This is a <span class="txt-italic">proximate</span> explanation – an explanation in terms of what is going on ‘here and now.’ We can also ask how this bird came to have these properties that now govern its life. This question has to be answered by an explanation in evolutionary terms; the <span class="txt-italic">ultimate</span> explanation of the present distribution and abundance of this bird lies in the ecological experiences of its ancestors (see <span id="widget-62534" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62534" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62534"></div>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In order to understand something, of course, we must first have a description of whatever it is we wish to understand. Ecologists must therefore <span class="txt-italic">describe</span> before they explain. On the other hand, the most valuable descriptions are those carried out with a particular problem or ‘need for understanding’ in mind. Undirected description, carried out merely for its own sake, is often later found to have selected the wrong things and has little place in ecology—or any other science.</p>
<p class="para indent">Ecologists also often try to <span class="txt-italic">predict</span>. For example, how will global warming affect the sequestration (storage) of carbon in natural ecosystems? Will warming reduce this storage, and therefore result in even more global warming since less carbon dioxide will be removed from the atmosphere? Often, ecologists are interested in what will happen to a population of organisms under a particular set of circumstances, and on the basis of these predictions to control, exploit or conserve the population. We try to minimize the effects of locust plagues by predicting when they are likely to occur and taking appropriate action. We try to exploit crops most effectively by predicting when conditions will be favorable to the crop and unfavorable to its enemies. We try to preserve rare species by predicting the conservation policy that will enable us to do so. Some prediction and control can be carried out without deep explanation or understanding: it is not difficult to predict that the destruction of a woodland will eliminate woodland birds. But what if the woodland is not destroyed, but rather fragmented into distinct parts with suburbs or agricultural fields between them? What effect may this have on the woodland birds? Insightful predictions, precise predictions, and predictions of what will happen in unusual circumstances can be made only when we can also explain and understand what is going on.</p>

<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">In order to understand the mechanistic reasons that a particular property is observed at any level of biological organization, a scientist needs to look at the next lowest level of organization.

<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">However, properties observed at a given level of organization may be predicted without fully understanding the functioning at lower levels. This third generality may seem to contradict the other two, but it does not. Consider an analogy from the physical sciences. As early as 1662, Boyle knew that when the pressure of a gas is doubled, its volume is halved, if temperature remains constant. This behavior of the gas as a whole is the result of the interactions of the gas molecules, yet Boyle’s law provided valuable predictive power for centuries, long before the concept of the molecule was developed. Today, physical chemists can indeed explain gas behavior based on understanding of the behavior of individual molecules, but the explanation is complex, and not even taught to most undergraduate college students. Similarly, ecologists can predict patterns in ecosystems without understanding all of the details of the dynamics of constituent populations, and can predict patterns in populations without understanding all of the details of the responses of individual organisms.</p></li>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">The appropriate time scale for ecological investigation varies with the question to be answered. However, many ecological studies end up being shorter than appropriate for the question, due to human frailties. Longer studies cost more and require greater dedication and stamina. The often short-term nature of funding, an impatient scientific community, and the requirement for concrete evidence of activity for career progression all put pressure on ecologists (and all scientists) to publish their work sooner rather than later. Why are long-term studies potentially of such value? The reduction over a few years in the numbers of a particular species of wild flower, or bird, or butterfly might be a cause for conservation concern—but one or more decades of study may be needed to be sure that the decline is more than just an expression of the random ups and downs of ‘normal’ population dynamics. One of the longest, continuously run ecological studies is at the Hubbard Brook Experiment Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Among other measures, Gene Liken and other scientists there have monitored the acidity of rain since the early 1960s. In the 1960s, the rain was quite acidic (low pH: high hydrogen ion concentrations), and this was in fact one of the earliest discoveries anywhere of the phenomenon of acid rain. The long-term trend, though, has been for precipitation to become less acidic over subsequent decades (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0004">Figure 1.4</a>); but we can observe this only because we have that long-term record.

In this way, ecologists may establish patterns, for example, that red grouse (birds shot for ‘sport’) exhibit regular cycles in abundance peaking every 4 or 5 years. Documenting the pattern does not provide explanation for the cause of the cycle, but it is a start toward understanding. A next step might be to development one or more hypotheses to explain the pattern: for instance, perhaps the 4- to 5-year cycle is caused by a gradual accumulation of parasitic worms in the grouse populations over this period of time. A <span class="txt-bold">manipulative field experiment</span> is one approach to test such a hypothesis, in this case by ridding the grouse of the parasites and monitoring whether the 4- to 5-year population cycle persists. Treating the grouse for their parasites strongly dampens the population cycle, giving strong support to this hypothesis (Hudson, Dobson, &amp; Newborn, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0264">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0264</a>-->1998).</p>

<p class="para indent">We can also use <span class="txt-bold">comparative field observations</span> to test hypotheses. That is, we explicitly compare the same sort of data from many different sites. Consider the question whether the amount of nitrogen pollution deposited onto the landscape in rain, snow, dust, and gases affects the biodiversity of grassland communities (nitrogen is a major component of acid rain). The extent of this nitrogen pollution varies greatly over the landscape of Europe, so we can test the hypothesis that more nitrogen pollution lowers biodiversity by comparing diversity in different grasslands receiving different inputs of nitrogen pollution from the atmosphere (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0005">Figure 1.5</a>). The diversity of forbs (broad-leaved herbs) is indeed lower when nitrogen pollution is greater, but the diversity of grasses increases with increasing nitrogen pollution. The scatter in the relationships is great, but the relationships are nonetheless significant. (We will discuss what we mean by “significant” later in this chapter.) The scatter is undoubtedly the result of other factors across the landscape – in addition to the nitrogen pollution – that might also affect diversity, such as types of soil, differences in precipitation and other climate variables, and other types of pollution and disturbance.</p>

<p class="para indent">Rather than relying on this comparative observational approach, we could conduct a manipulative field experiment to test the hypothesis that nitrogen pollution affects biodiversity. The result of one such experiment shows a very tight and pronounced effect of increasing nitrogen supply on biodiversity (expressed as species richness, the number of species) after just 4 years of nitrogen addition (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0006">Figures 1.6</a>). This experiment has an advantage over the comparative observational study, in that other confounding variables – soil type, climate, disturbance history – are held constant between treatments and hence eliminated, and this probably explains the tighter relationship between nitrogen and diversity. On the other hand, the experiment is conducted on just one type of soil, with one type of climate and disturbance history, and over a fairly limited period of time (4 years in this case), and so the result may not fully apply to other areas and to longer time scales. Both manipulative experiments and observations are critical to ecology, and ecologists gain confidence in their understanding of nature when the two approaches lead to similar conclusions.</p>

<p class="para indent">Why might nitrogen affect plant biodiversity? One hypothesis is that the effect is one of fertilization, with plants growing more as the nitrogen supply increases, and this leading to less diversity as species that grow particularly well come to dominate the community and shade out other plants. A creative experiment gave some preliminary support for this hypothesis: when artificial light was supplied to the shaded plants of the understory in nitrogen fertilized plots, biodiversity was maintained despite the higher nitrogen (Hautier et al., <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0237">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0237</a>-->2009).</p>

Are the intestinal worms actually capable of having an effect on reproduction or mortality of individual grouse? How do light and nitrogen interact to regulate the growth rate of the various species in a grassland ecosystem?

But we have little hope of doing so unless we already have some basic understanding of even simpler communities of just one predator and one prey species, or two competitors, or (especially ambitious) two competitors that also share a common predator. For this, it is usually most appropriate to construct, for our own convenience, simple laboratory systems that can act as benchmarks or jumping-off points in our search for understanding.</p>

Determining the biomass of the plants at the end of the experiment is relatively simple (cutting, drying, and weighing); characterizing the diversity of the community is more difficult, particularly if the diversity is high with many species potentially present; measuring the rate at which each species is assimilating nitrogen is far, far more difficult and time consuming.

<p class="para indent">As noted by David Schindler (1998<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0522">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0522</a>-->), experiments can often involve a trade-off between realism and replication. Smaller scale experiments – such as small plots of grassland, or 50-gallon containers of pond water – make replication relatively easy, but this scale cannot capture all of the complex interactions inherent in natural ecosystems. Schindler has devoted his career to whole-ecosystem experiments, for instance, adding nutrients, acids, or toxins to whole lakes and following the response of the lake ecosystem. At this scale, replication is difficult at best, and many whole-ecosystem experiments have not used replicate treatments. An excellent example is the work of Schindler and colleagues (1985), who added sulfuric acid to one lake (no replication) over a period of many years, to determine what the consequences of acid rain on lakes might be. To understand the effects of the acidification, they observed the lake for a period of years before acidification, and then observed the behavior of the acidified lake in comparison to other nearby reference lakes as acidification was gradually increased. They found remarkable effects at levels of acidity far less than lab studies of the time had indicated were likely to be a problem. For instance, the populations of crayfish and small minnows in the lake declined, and this led to deleterious consequences for the top predator, the lake trout (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0008">Figure 1.8</a>), and to their eventual disappearance from the lake. Note also that while the experimental treatment (acidification) was not replicated, the scientists took a large number of replicate samples for the response variables of interest (for instance, numbers of crayfish) in both the acidified and reference lakes over time, making statistically significant conclusions possible. While at first glance it may seem distasteful to purposely pollute a lake, this whole-lake experiment clearly demonstrated more severe effects of acid rain on lakes than had previously been believed possible, and this led to pressure to reduce acid rain, protecting a far greater number of lakes than the one damaged in the experiment.</p>

<p class="para">ecology relies on representative samples</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Ecologists often seek to draw conclusions about overall groups of organisms or overall trends in processes or fluxes: what is the trend in abundance over time of the crayfish in the lake experiment, described above? What is the birth rate of the bears in Yellowstone Park? What is the density of weeds in a wheat field? What is the rate of loss in streams of nitrogen from forests? In doing so, we can only very rarely examine every individual in a group, or in the entire sampling area, or all the nitrogen in all the water leaving a forest. We must therefore rely on what we hope will be a representative sample from the group or habitat or flux. Indeed, even if we examined a whole group (we might examine every fish in a small pond, say), we are likely to want to draw general conclusions from it: we might hope that the fish in ‘our’ pond can tell us something about fish of that species in ponds of that type, generally. In short, ecology relies on obtaining <span class="txt-italic">estimates</span> from representative samples. This is elaborated in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fea-0003">Box 1.3</a>.</p>

<p class="para indent">To understand the application of these goals, consider another hypothetical example: the density of a particular weed (e.g., wild oat) in a wheat field. To prevent bias, each part of the field should have an equal chance of being selected for sampling, so sampling units should be selected at random. We might, for example, divide the field into a measured grid, pick points on the grid at random, and count the wild oat plants within a 50 cm radius of the selected grid point. This unbiased method can be contrasted with a plan to sample only weeds from between the rows of wheat plants, giving too high an estimate, or within the rows, giving too low an estimate (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0009">Figure 1.9a</a>).</p>

<p class="para indent">What, though, if we suspect that the slope of a field affects weed density, and half the field slopes to the southeast and half to the southwest? The individual values from samples may then fall into two groups a substantial distance apart on the density scale: high from the southwest slope; low (mostly zero) from the southeast slope. The estimated mean weed density would be close to the true mean (it would be accurate and unbiased), but the variation among samples would be large and the estimate therefore imprecise (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0009">Figure 1.9b</a>). If, however, we acknowledge the difference between the two slopes and treat them separately from the outset, then we obtain means for each that have much smaller confidence intervals. What is more, if we average those means and combine their confidence intervals to obtain an estimate for the field as a whole, then that interval too is much smaller than previously.</p>
<p class="para indent">But has our effort been directed sensibly, with equal numbers of samples from the southwest slope, where there are lots of weeds, and the southeast slope, where there are virtually none? The answer is no. If our efforts had been directed mostly at sampling the southwest slope, the increased amount of data would have noticeably decreased the variation, whereas less sampling of the southeast slope would have made very little difference (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0009">Figure 1.9c</a>). Careful direction of a sampling program can clearly increase overall precision for a given investment in effort.</p>

Widespread familiarity with the idea, however, does not mean that we understand fully the processes that drive or fine-tune successions; yet developing such understanding is important not just because succession is one of the fundamental forces structuring ecological communities, but also because human disturbance of natural communities has become ever more frequent and profound. We need to know how communities may respond to, and hopefully recover from, such disturbance, and how we may aid that recovery.</p>
<p class="para indent">One particular focus for the study of succession has been the old agricultural fields of the eastern and northern United States, abandoned as farmers moved west in search of ‘fresh fields and pastures new.’ One such site is now the Cedar Creek Natural History Area, roughly 50 km north of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The area was first settled by Europeans in 1856 and was initially subject to logging. Clearing for cultivation then began about 1885, and land was first cultivated between 1900 and 1910. Now there are agricultural fields that are still under cultivation and others that have been abandoned at various times since the mid-1920s. Cultivation led to depletion of nitrogen from soils that already were naturally poor in this important plant nutrient.</p>

<p class="para indent">Studies at Cedar Creek illustrate the value of <span class="txt-bold">natural experiments</span>. A natural experiment is not planned before hand, but rather ecologists take advantage of a situation where either natural events (the retreat of a glacier, to evaluate how plants recolonize soils) or human-controlled events set the stage to learn something about ecological processes. The Cedar Creek studies, begun only in the 1980s, take advantage of the abandonment of agricultural land beginning many decades earlier. To understand the successional sequence of plants that occur in fields in the years following abandonment, we <span class="txt-italic">could</span> plan an artificial manipulation, under our control, in which a number of fields currently under cultivation were forcibly abandoned and the communities in them sampled repeatedly into the future. (We would need a number of fields because any single field might be atypical, whereas several would allow us to calculate mean values for, say, the number of new species per year, and place confidence intervals around those means.) But the results of this experiment would take decades to accumulate. The natural experiment alternative, therefore, was to use the fact that records already exist of when many of the old fields were abandoned. This is what David Tilman and his team did. <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0010">Figure 1.10</a> illustrates data from a group of 22 old fields surveyed in 1983, having been abandoned at various times between 1927 and 1982 (i.e., between 1 and 56 years previously). These can be treated as 22 ‘snapshots’ of the continuous process of succession in old fields at Cedar Creek in general, even though each field was itself only surveyed once.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Hubbard Brook: a long-term commitment to study at the ecosystem scale</h2>
<p class="para">The Cedar Creek study took advantage of space-for-time substitutions, inferring information on ecological processes that occur over decades (old field succession in Minnesota) from current spatial patterns. For longer time scales, this may be the only approach for understanding ecological processes and controls. At shorter time scales, though, actual observations are possible. As noted briefly above, a project started by Gene Likens together with many other colleagues, notably Herb Bormann, has been doing precisely this in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest since the early 1960s. In part because of the noted success of having long-term continuous data demonstrated at Hubbard Brook, the U.S. National Science Foundation has now for several decades supported a network of Long-Term Ecological Research sites, in a variety of different types of ecosystems. Currently, 26 such sites are funded (<span id="widget-62542" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62542" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">http://www.lternet.edu/</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62542"></div>).

<p class="para">the catchment area as a unit of study</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">An early accomplishment of the Hubbard Brook team was to develop the small watershed technique to measure the input and output of chemicals from individual forest areas. Because most of the chemical losses from forests such as those at Hubbard Brook (with shallow soils, underlain by impermeable bedrock) are channeled through streams, a comparison of the chemistry of stream water with that of incoming precipitation can reveal a lot about the differential uptake and cycling of chemical elements by the terrestrial biota. These small watersheds are often called <span class="txt-bold">catchments</span>.</p>
<p class="para indent">In their catchment studies, the Hubbard Brooks scientists measured (and continue to measure!) the inputs of acids, nutrients, and other materials from the atmosphere. They use a variety of tools, but the simplest is to measure total precipitation (rain and snow) and the concentrations of materials in the precipitation (measured in plastic buckets, which are only open to the air when it is raining), as well as what falls in other buckets at times of no rain (automatic sensors move covers depending upon whether it is raining or not). The scientists also measure what leaves the catchments in streamflow, using carefully gauged streams which provide a precise measure of water flow over time and periodic sampling of the chemicals dissolved in that stream water. Their early results (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-tbl-0001">Table 1.1</a>) were very surprising for the time, and of great interest: for many substances, the export from the forest exceeded inputs from the air (the result of weathering of the soil and bedrock material). But for nitrogen (both ammonium, NH<sub class="txt-sub default">4</sub>+, and nitrate, NO<sub class="txt-sub default">3</sub>−) the export from the ecosystem was less than the inputs: the forest was retaining a large amount of the nitrogen inputs.</p>

<p class="para indent">Likens and colleagues also pioneered the idea of performing large-scale ecological experiments at the catchment scale. Hydrologists had done similar experiments before but had not explored the ecological ramifications. In the first of the ecologically oriented experiments, the Hubbard Brook team completely cut down all of the trees in one small catchment, as commercial loggers sometimes do in what is called a “clear cut” (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0011">Figure 1.11</a>), and compared the response of export of materials in stream-water with that in another 5 reference watersheds. The overall export of dissolved inorganic substances from the disturbed catchment rose to 13 times the normal rate (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0012">Figure 1.12</a>). Two phenomena were responsible. First, the enormous reduction in transpiring surfaces (leaves) on live trees led to 40% more of the input precipitation being exported again as water in the streams, carrying with it more dissolved substances. Second, and more importantly, as microbes decomposed organic matter and made substances available in solution, the trees no longer were there to assimilate these materials; rather, they were flushed from the system with the exported water.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Canada’s Experimental Lakes Area: decades of exploring the consequences of human activities on lakes</h2>
<p class="para">Earlier in this chapter, we briefly noted the work by David Schindler and others on a whole-ecosystem experiment to understand the effects of acid rain on lakes. That experiment was one of many performed at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), a research reserve run by the Canadian government in a sparsely populated area of central Canada. ELA was originally established in 1968 to study the problem of <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c01-tdef-0007" title="enrichment of a water body with plant nutrients; usually resulting in a community dominated by phytoplankton" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - eutrophication">eutrophication</span> in lakes: excess growth of algae and cyanobacteria as a result of excessive inputs of nutrients.</p>
<p class="para indent">During the 1950s and 1960s, water quality in lakes deteriorated in many areas across North America and Europe, with eutrophication being one of the biggest concerns. A considerable amount of research tried to discern the cause. Most of this consisted of laboratory experiments, often adding nutrients such as phosphorus or nitrogen, or adding carbon as inorganic bicarbonate, to bottles of water from ponds or lakes, and analyzing the response in terms of growth of phytoplankton over a period of a few days to a week. The results were conflicting, with many studies suggesting that algal growth and production was primarily limited by carbon dioxide and bicarbonate availability, while others indicated control by phosphorus or sometimes nitrogen. Without a clear cause, strong corrective policies could not be developed. For instance, if the problem were phosphorus, one partial solution would be to ban phosphorus from detergents that contributed to wastewater inputs. But without a clear consensus, agreement on a phosphorous ban or other policy actions was not possible. If algal growth were really controlled by the amount of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate in a lake, then controlling phosphorus would be of little value.</p>
<p class="para indent">In response to concern over eutrophication in the Great Lakes, the Canadian government established the Freshwater Institute in 1966, hiring Schindler early in 1968 to run the whole-lake eutrophication experiment (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0013">Figure 1.13</a>). Schindler and his team put in an access road to the remote area, set up a base camp, and surveyed many lakes, identifying over 50 that were suitable for whole-lake experiments. The ELA group hypothesized that eutrophication was caused by phosphorus, and they designed a set of experiments to test this. Their first experiment was a daring one: they chose a lake (Lake 227) that had extremely low levels of dissolved carbon dioxide, less than any other lake anywhere in the world studied to that time, and proposed to fertilize it with phosphorus. Lab experiments with water from Lake 227 had already “proven” that the low carbon dioxide of the lake strongly limited production by algae, but Schindler and his colleagues had confidence that a whole-lake experiment would yield a different result. As Schindler (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0521">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0521</a>-->2009) later argued, if they could prove that phosphorus was actually the main stimulant of production even in an ecosystem such as Lake 227, with extremely low carbon dioxide, it would disprove the carbon hypothesis generally.</p>

<span class="figure-title">Figure 1.13</span>
<span class="figure-caption block">In the Lake 226 experiment, one side of the lake received nitrogen additions alone, while the other side received both nitrogen and phosphorus. A plastic barrier prevented exchange of water between the two sides of the lake. The stimulation of algal growth by the phosphorus is clearly seen by the green color in that half of the lake. Reprinted from Schindler (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0520">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0520</a>-->1977).</span></div>

<p class="para indent">Over the winter of 1968–1969, they hauled the phosphorus to the remote lake, using sleds pulled by snowmobiles. The team began adding phosphorus in June 1969, and Lake 227 rapidly became eutrophic. Despite the low carbon dioxide in the lake, enough became available to support algal growth, due to diffusion both from the atmosphere and from the carbon-rich sediments. The carbon dioxide limitation demonstrated in the laboratory experiments with water from Lake 227 had been an artifact: the rate of supply of new carbon dioxide to the water in the bottles of lab experiments was far slower than that to the waters of the lake itself. Phosphorus was the real control on algal growth and eutrophication in lakes. A subsequent experiment in another lake divided in half by a plastic barrier showed huge stimulation from fertilization with both phosphorus and nitrogen, compared to nitrogen alone (look again at <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0013">Figure 1.13</a>). The publication of the first results from these experiments led quickly to regulation across North America and Europe to reduce phosphorus pollution, and the Great Lakes and other lakes responded quickly in improved water quality. The problem of eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems has unfortunately taken many decades longer to solve, since the cause there is primarily nitrogen and not phosphorus (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fea-0004">Box 1.4</a>).</p>

<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">The Deterioration of Coastal Marine Ecosystems</h5>
<p class="para">While lake-water quality has improved dramatically as a result of regulations to reduce phosphorus inputs, coastal marine ecosystems have become steadily more eutrophic since the early 1970s. In fact, by 2007, a majority of the coastal marine waters in the United States were moderately to severely degraded from eutrophication, despite the phosphorus controls. Worldwide, harmful algal blooms in coastal waters have become more common (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0014">Figure 1.14</a>), as have areas depleted of oxygen (“dead zones”) such as that in the northern Gulf of Mexico in the plume of the Mississippi River. Why? Eutrophication of these marine ecosystems is caused more by nitrogen than by phosphorus, and the regulation of nitrogen pollution has lagged behind phosphorus regulation by decades in most countries. That nitrogen is the major cause of coastal eutrophication was well demonstrated in a “mesocosm” experiment on the shore of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. (Mesocosms are experimental arenas large enough to capture many features of natural systems, in contrast to smaller and less natural ‘microcosms.’) Pairs of large fiberglass tanks filled with seawater from the Bay were enriched with either phosphorus or nitrogen, or left unenriched as controls. The rate of phosphorus input was the same as for the Lake 227 experiment at ELA, described in the main text. Phosphorus caused no increased in production or amount of algae in the water, but nitrogen fertilization resulted in much higher quantities and growth of algae (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0014">Figure 1.14</a>).</p>

<p class="para indent">Many factors lead to the differences in the control of eutrophication in lakes and coastal marine ecosystems. One of the most important is the large supply of phosphorus relative to nitrogen that often enters coastal marine ecosystems from adjacent oceanic waters. Another factor is nitrogen fixation, the process whereby bacteria can convert atmospheric molecular nitrogen into biologically available nitrogen. When nitrogen is in short supply in lakes, cyanobacteria typically increase rapidly in abundance (‘bloom’) and fix nitrogen, alleviating the shortage and maintaining phosphorus as the limiting nutrient. This response by cyanobacteria simply does not occur in most coastal marine ecosystems, as we discuss further in <span id="widget-62543" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62543" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62543"></div>.<p></p>

<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">In many cases, the nitrogen that flows to coastal waters and causes eutrophication originates upstream in river basins at distances of hundreds to a thousand kilometers from the coast, often in different countries or states. The necessary actions to solve the problems occur upstream, but the damage that occurs without action is along the coast. How can societies solve coastal eutrophication in an equitable manner, given this spatial disjunction? Who should pay to reduce the nitrogen pollution?</p></li>

<p class="para indent">Microscopic algae growing on rocks compose the base of the food chain in most south New Zealand streams. Mayfly nymphs and other invertebrates graze on the microscopic algae, and they in turn are fed upon by fish. Strikingly, the behavior of nymphs differs depending on whether they are in <span class="txt-italic">Galaxias</span> or brown-trout streams. In one experiment, nymphs collected from a trout stream and placed in small artificial laboratory channels were less active during the day than the night, whereas those collected from a <span class="txt-italic">Galaxias</span> stream were active both day and night (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0015">Figure 1.15</a>). Why might this difference have evolved? Trout rely principally on vision to capture prey, whereas <span class="txt-italic">Galaxias</span> rely on mechanical cues. Thus, invertebrates in a trout stream are considerably more at risk of predation during daylight hours when the trout can see best and are most active.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Why Asian vultures were heading for extinction: The value of a modeling study</h2>
<p class="para">In 1997, vultures in India and Pakistan began dropping from their perches. Local people were quick to notice dramatic declines in numbers of the oriental white-backed vulture <span class="txt-italic">Gyps bengalensis</span> (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0018">Figure 1.18</a>) and the long-billed vulture <span class="txt-italic">G. indicus</span>. Repeated population surveys from 2000 to 2003 confirmed alarming rates of decline: between 22% and 50% of the population was being lost each year. This was of very great concern because of the crucial role vultures play in everyday life for people in India and Pakistan, disposing of the dead bodies of large animals, both wild and domestic. The loss of vultures enhanced carrion availability to wild dogs and rats, allowing their populations to increase and raising the probability of diseases such as rabies and plague being transmitted to humans. Moreover, contamination of nearby wells and the spread of disease by flies became more likely now that dead animals were not quickly picked clean by vultures. One group of people, the Parsees, were even more intimately affected, because their religion calls for the dead to be taken in daylight to a special tower (dakhma) where the body is stripped clean by vultures within a few hours. It was crucial for ecologists to quickly determine the cause of vulture declines so that action could be taken.</p>

<p class="para indent">It took scientists a few years to find a common element in the deaths of otherwise healthy birds – each had suffered from visceral gout (accumulation of uric acid in the body cavity) followed by kidney failure. Soon a crucial piece in the jigsaw became clear: vultures dying of visceral gout contained residues of the drug diclofenac (Oaks et al., <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0438">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0438</a>-->2004). Then it was confirmed that carcasses of domestic animals treated with diclofenac were lethal to captive vultures. Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug developed for human use in the 1970s, had only recently come into common use as a veterinary medicine in Pakistan and India. Thus, a drug that benefited domestic mammals proved lethal to the vultures that fed on their bodies.</p>

<p class="para">… caused by drug-contaminated carcasses?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The circumstantial evidence was strong, but given the relatively small numbers of diclofenac-contaminated dead bodies available to wild vultures, was the associated vulture mortality sufficient explanation for the population crashes? Or might other factors also be at play? Were there other toxins? This was the question addressed by Rhys Green and his team by means of a simulation population model (Green et al. <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0216">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0216</a>-->2004). On the basis of their surveys of population declines and knowledge of birth, death and feeding rates, the researchers built a mathematical model to predict the behavior of the vulture populations. We show their model as a flow diagram (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c01-fig-0018">Figure 1.18</a>).</p>
<p class="para indent">The model was based on a series of simple and well-articulated assumptions. For example, they assumed that vultures do not breed until they are five years old, and then are capable of rearing only one juvenile per year, but only if both parents survive the breeding season of 160 days. Other model inputs specify normal birth and death rates for the population, but also how survival may depend on dicofenac poisoning. This reflects the probability an adult will eat from a diclofenac-affected carcass, which in turn depends partly on the proportion of carcasses in the environment that contain diclofenac and partly on how often vultures feed. As you might guess, there is a lot of complexity, and a lot of good biology, behind these assumptions.</p>

<p class="para">diclofenac-contaminated cattle are sufficient to explain vulture decline</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">Mathematical formulae were developed to predict changes in population size, but the details need not concern us here. More specifically, the researchers posed the question: what proportion of carcasses (<span class="txt-italic">C</span>) would have to contain lethal doses of diclofenac to cause the observed population declines? The model showed that only 1 in 135 carcasses would have to contain diclofenac to cause the observed population decline. The proportions of vultures found dead or dying in the wild with signs of diclofenac poisoning were closely similar to the proportions of deaths expected from the model if the observed population decline was due <span class="txt-italic">entirely</span> to diclofenac poisoning. The researchers concluded, therefore, that diclofenac poisoning was a sufficient cause for the dramatic decline of wild vultures. As a result of this research, governments have taken action to ban the use of diclofenac.</p>

<section class="section-3" id="c02-sec-0003">
<p class="para">An awareness of the diversity of living organisms, and of what lives where, is part of the knowledge that the human species accumulates and hands down through the generations. Hunter–gatherers needed (and still need) detailed knowledge of the natural history of the plants and animals in their immediate environment in order to obtain food successfully and escape the hazards of being poisoned or eaten.</p>
<p class="para indent">More than 4,000 years ago, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung compiled what was perhaps the first written ‘herbal’ of useful plants; and by around 2,000 years ago, the Greek, Dioscorides, had described 500 species of medicinal plants and illustrated many of them in his <span class="txt-italic">De Materia Medica</span>, which remained in use through the following 1,500 years.</p>
<p class="para indent">Collections of living specimens in zoos and botanic gardens also have a long history – certainly back to Greece almost 3,000 years ago. Then, in the 17th century, the urge to collect from the diversity of nature developed in the West, allowing some individuals to make their living by finding interesting specimens for other people’s collections. For example, John Tradescant the father (died 1638) and John Tradescant the son (1608–1662) spent most of their lives collecting plants abroad for the gardens of the British aristocracy. The father was the first English botanist to visit Russia (1618), bringing back many living plants. His son made three visits to collect specimens in the American colonies.</p>
<p class="para indent">Wealthy individuals built up vast collections into personal museums and traveled or sent travelers in search of novelties from new lands as they were discovered and colonized. Naturalists and artists (often the same people) were sent to accompany the major voyages of exploration, to report and take home, dead or alive, collections of the diversity of organisms and artifacts that they found. Taxonomy (giving names to the various types of organism) and systematics (organizing and classifying them) developed and flourished.</p>
<p class="para indent">When big national museums were established (the British Museum in 1759 and the Smithsonian in Washington in 1846), they were largely compiled from the gifts of personal collections. Like zoos and botanic gardens, the museums’ main role was to make a public display of the diversity of nature, especially the new and curious and rare.</p>
<p class="para indent">There was no need to explain the diversity—the biblical theory of the seven-day creation of the world sufficed. However, the idea that the diversity of nature had ‘evolved’ over time, by progressive divergence from preexisting stocks, was beginning to be discussed around the end of the 18th century. Then, in 1844, Robert Chambers, a Scottish journalist, published his <span class="txt-italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> (though it was published anonymously at the time)—a popular account of the idea that animal species had descended from other species. This paved the way for the wider acceptance of Darwin’s <span class="txt-italic">On the Origin of Species</span>, published 15 years later.</p>

<p class="para indent">In 1858, Wallace, who had read Darwin’s journal of the voyage of the <span class="txt-italic">Beagle</span>, wrote to Darwin, spelling out, in all its essentials, the same theory of evolution. Wallace was a passionate amateur naturalist. From 1847 to 1852, with his friend H. W. Bates, he explored and collected in the river basins of the Amazon and Rio Negro, and from 1854 to 1862 he made an extensive expedition in the Malay Archipelago. He recalled lying on his bed in 1858 ‘in the hot fit of intermittent fever, when the idea [of natural selection] suddenly came to me. I thought it all out before the fit was over, and … I believe I finished the first draft the next day.’</p>
<p class="para indent">Today, competition for fame and financial support would no doubt lead to fierce conflict about priority—who had the idea first. Instead, in an outstanding example of selflessness in science, sketches of Darwin’s and Wallace’s ideas were presented together at a meeting of the Linnean Society in London (where portraits of both still hang today). Darwin’s <span class="txt-italic">On the Origin of Species</span> was then hastily prepared and published in 1859. It is arguably the first major textbook of ecology. Aspiring ecologists would do well to read at least the third chapter.</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">Both Darwin and Wallace had read <span class="txt-italic">An Essay on the Principle of Population</span>, published by Thomas Malthus in 1798. Malthus’s essay was concerned with human population growth, which, if it remained unchecked, could easily overrun the planet. He realized, though, that limited resources, as well as disease, wars, and other disasters, slowed the growth of populations—that only a small proportion of those born, or who might have been born, actually survived. As experienced field naturalists, Darwin and Wallace realized that the Malthusian argument applied with equal force to the whole of the plant and animal kingdoms.</p>
<p class="para indent">Darwin noted the great fecundity of some species— a single individual of the sea slug <span class="txt-italic">Doris</span> may produce 600,000 eggs; the parasitic roundworm <span class="txt-italic">Ascaris</span> may produce 64 million. But he realized that every species ‘must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product.’ And he checked his ideas: in one of the earliest examples of population ecology, Darwin counted all the seedlings that emerged from a plot of cultivated ground three feet by two feet: ‘Out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects.’ Darwin and Wallace, then, emphasized that most individuals die before they can reproduce and contribute nothing to future generations. Both, though, tended to ignore the important fact that those individuals that do survive in a population may leave different numbers of descendants.</p>

<p class="para">“the survival of the fittest”?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">But which individuals make the disproportionately large contributions to subsequent generations and hence determine the direction that evolution takes? The answer is: those that were best able to survive the risks and hazards of the environments in which they were born and grew; and those who, having survived, were most capable of successful reproduction. Thus, interactions between organisms and their environments—the stuff of ecology—lie at the heart of the process of evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p class="para indent">The philosopher Herbert Spencer described the process as “the survival of the fittest,” and the phrase has entered everyday language—which is regrettable. First, we now know that survival is only part of the story: differential reproduction is often equally important. But more worryingly, even if we limit ourselves to survival, the phrase gets us nowhere. Who are the fittest?—those that survive. Who survives?—those that are fittest. Nonetheless, the term <span class="txt-italic">fitness</span> is commonly used to describe the success of individuals in the process of natural selection. An individual will survive better, reproduce more, and leave more descendants—it will be fitter—in some environments than in others. And in a given environment, some individuals will be fitter than others.</p>

<p class="para">natural selection has no aim for the future</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Darwin had been greatly influenced by the achievements of plant and animal breeders—for example, the extraordinary variety of pigeons, dogs, and farm animals that had been deliberately bred by selecting individual parents with exaggerated traits. He and Wallace saw nature doing the same thing—‘selecting’ those individuals that survived from their excessively multiplying populations—hence the phrase ‘natural selection.’ But even this phrase can give the wrong impression. There is a great difference between human and natural selection. Human selection has an aim for the future—to breed a cereal with a higher yield, a more attractive pet dog, or a cow that will produce more milk. But nature has no aim. Evolution happens because some individuals have survived the death and destruction of the past, and have reproduced more successfully in the past: not because they were somehow chosen or selected as improvements for the future.</p>
<p class="para indent">Hence, past environments may be said to have selected particular characteristics of individuals that we see in present-day populations. Those characteristics are suited to present-day environments only because environments tend to remain the same, or at least change only very slowly. We shall see later in this chapter that when environments do change more rapidly, often under human influence, organisms can find themselves, for a time, left ‘high and dry’ by the experiences of their ancestors.</p>

</aside>
<p class="para">The natural world is not composed of a continuum of types of organism each grading into the next: we recognize boundaries between one sort of organism and another. In one of the great achievements of biological science, the Swede, Carl Linnaeus, devised in 1789 an orderly system for naming the different sorts. Part of his genius was to recognize that there were features of both plants and animals that were not easily modified by the organisms’ immediate environment, and that these ‘conservative’ characteristics were especially useful for classifying organisms. In flowering plants, the form of the flowers is particularly stable. Nevertheless, within what we recognize as species, there is often considerable variation, and some of this is heritable. It is on such intraspecific variation, after all, that plant and animal breeders work. In nature, some of this intraspecific variation is clearly correlated with variations in the environment and represents local specialization.</p>
<p class="para indent">Darwin called his book <span class="txt-italic">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</span>, but evolution by natural selection does far more than create new species. Natural selection and evolution occur <span class="txt-italic">within</span> species, and we now know that we can study them in action within our own lifetime. Moreover, we need to study the way that evolution occurs within species if we are to understand the origin of new species.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">Since the environments experienced by a species in different parts of its range are themselves different (to at least some extent), we might expect natural selection to have favored different variants of the species at different sites. But the characteristics of populations will diverge from each other only if there is sufficient heritable variation on which selection can act, and only if the forces of selection favoring divergence are strong enough to counteract the mixing and hybridization of individuals from different sites. Two populations will not diverge completely if their members (or, in the case of plants, their pollen) are continually migrating between them, mating and mixing their genes.</p>
<p class="para indent">The sapphire rockcress, <span class="txt-italic">Arabis fecunda</span>, is a rare perennial herb restricted to calcareous soil outcrops in western Montana—so rare, in fact, that there are just 19 existing populations separated into two groups (‘high elevation’ and ‘low elevation’) by a distance of around 100 km. Whether there is local adaptation here is of practical importance: four of the low-elevation populations are under threat from spreading urban areas and may require reintroduction from elsewhere if they are to be sustained. But the low-elevation sites were more prone to drought—both the air and the soil were warmer and drier there—and reintroduction may therefore fail if local adaptation is too marked. Observing plants in their own habitats and checking for differences between them would not tell us if there was local adaptation in the evolutionary sense. Differences may simply be the result of immediate responses to contrasting environments made by plants that are essentially the same. Hence, high- and low-elevation plants were grown together in a ‘common garden,’ eliminating any influence of contrasting immediate environments. The low-elevation plants in the common garden were indeed significantly more drought-tolerant (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0002">Figure 2.2</a>).

The work started in the 1960s with plants being taken from various points along the transect and grown for almost 2 years in a common garden before being tested. There was a most striking increase in tolerance over a distance of only 3 m at the transition from the pasture to the mine-derived plants (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0004">Figure 2.4a</a>)—testimony to the power of the selective forces favoring tolerance in plants growing in contaminated soil. But as we have already noted, such evolution can have occurred only if hybridization between plants on either side of the transition had failed to counteract it. <span class="txt-bold">Hybridization</span>, the production of offspring sharing the characteristics of two parents, of course requires the exchange of genetic material between plants, which in turn requires that the plants be flowering at the same time.

Even if the plants had been thoroughly intermingled (not strung out along the transect), mating between tolerant and nontolerant individuals would have been more than 40% less than if flowering had been synchronous. This is not perfect reproductive isolation, clearly, but it is enough to allow the inherited variation in zinc tolerance within this species to become established and be maintained over remarkably short distances.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">It can be difficult to detect the local specialization of animals by transplanting them into each other’s habitat: if they don’t like it, most species will run away. But invertebrates like corals and sea anemones are sedentary, and some can be lifted from one place and established in another. The sea anemone <span class="txt-italic">Actinia tenebrosa</span> is found in rock pools and on boulders around the coast of New South Wales, Australia. A reciprocal transplant experiment was carried out at two locations, Cape Banks and Bass Point, at each of which sea anemones were translocated between replicate sites in pool and boulder habitats. At each site, all anemones, between 50 and 85 individuals, were removed and then transplanted, all together, at one of the other sites at that location, chosen at random. Following this, then, at both locations, there were boulder sites with rock pool anemones, boulder sites with (translocated) boulder anemones, rock pool sites with boulder anemones and rock pool sites with (translocated) rock pool anemones. This kind of design is essential: only by translocating not only to a different but also to the same habitat is it possible to distinguish the effects of local adaptation from any effects of translocation in its own right. Individuals were then monitored at their new sites for two years and a number of measures of fitness examined: the proportion surviving, the proportion brooding juveniles, and the growth (change in size) of survivors (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0006">Figure 2.6</a>). In almost every case, and in every case that was statistically significant, local adaptation was apparent: individuals did better in their own than in the alternative habitat. They were more likely to survive, more likely to be brooding juveniles of their own, and they grew more (or at least shrunk less).</p>

<p class="para">reciprocal transplants generally: local adaptation often but not always</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Once again, however, it is important to recognize that while reciprocal transplant experiments are usually undertaken to investigate local adaptation, confirmation of local adaptation is certainly not a general rule. This can be seen from a survey carried out all studies of reciprocal transplant experiments performed up to 2005 (Hereford, 2009<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0241">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0241</a>-->). Confining attention to those that were conducted in natural field environments, and that measured fitness directly through effects either on survival and/or fecundity, the survey yielded 74 studies, with 50 on plants and 21 on animals (and three on fungi or protists). These generated 360 cases where reciprocal local adaptation could be sought (because there were often several measures of survival and fecundity and because some populations were measured twice); but of these, only around half were able to confirm the pattern, and effect sizes were not always large (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0007">Figure 2.7</a>). In almost as many cases, one of the populations was simply fitter than the other, both in its native and in its nonnative site. Reciprocal transplant experiments are a good way of detecting local adaptation. But we should not be tempted into thinking that all populations are perfectly adapted to their local environments. Lack of genetic variation on which natural selection can act, the forces of hybridization, and delays between alterations to the environment and evolved, adaptive change in the population, all combine to ensure that this is by no means invariably so.</p>

In 43% of cases, one of the populations was fitter both in its native site and in that of the other population; these appear in the upper left and lower right quadrants.

<p class="para">natural selection by predation—a controlled field experiment in fish evolution</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In many of the examples so far, geographic variants of species have been identified, but the selective forces favoring them have not. This is not true of the next example, involving the guppy (<span class="txt-italic">Poecilia reticulata</span>), a small freshwater fish living in Trinidad, where many rivers are subdivided by waterfalls that isolate fish populations above the falls from those below. Guppies are present in many of these water bodies, coexisting in the lower waters with various species of predatory fish that are absent higher up the rivers. The populations of guppies in Trinidad differ from each other in almost every feature that biologists have examined. Forty-seven of these traits tend to vary in step with each other (they <span class="txt-italic">covary</span>) and with the intensity of the risk from predators. This correlation suggests that the guppy populations have been subject to natural selection from the predators. But the fact that two phenomena are correlated does not prove that one causes the other. Only controlled experiments can establish cause and effect.</p>
<p class="para indent">Whenever we study natural selection in action, it becomes clear that compromises are involved. For every selective force that favors change, there is a counteracting force that resists the change. Color in male guppies is a good example. Where guppies have been free or relatively free from predators, the males are brightly decorated with different numbers and sizes of colored spots (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0008">Figure 2.8</a>).

In the dark individuals, a dominant gene is responsible for producing an excess of the black pigment melanin. Industrial melanism is known in most industrialized countries, including some parts of the United States (e.g., Detroit, Pittsburgh), and more than a hundred species of moth have evolved forms of industrial melanism.</p>

Melanic forms were concentrated toward the east and were completely absent from unpolluted western parts of England, Wales, and northern Scotland.

<p class="para indent">The moths are preyed upon by insectivorous birds that hunt by sight. In a field experiment, large numbers of melanic and pale (‘typical’) moths were reared and released in equal numbers in a rural and largely unpolluted area of southern England. Of the 190 moths that were captured by birds, 164 were melanic and 26 were typicals. An equivalent study was made in an industrial area near the city of Birmingham. Twice as many melanics as typicals were recaught. This showed that a significant selection pressure was exerted through bird predation, and that moths of the typical form were clearly at a disadvantage in the polluted industrial environment (where their light color stood out against a sooty background), whereas the melanic forms were at a disadvantage in the pollution-free countryside (Kettlewell, 1955<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0317">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0317</a>-->).</p>
<p class="para indent">In the 1960s, however, industrialized environments in Western Europe and the United States started to change as oil and electricity began to replace coal, and legislation was passed to impose greatly reduced air pollution (see <span id="widget-62551" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62551" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62551"></div>). The frequency of melanic forms then fell back rapidly to near pre-Industrial levels, both nationwide and along the intensively studied transect (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0010">Figure 2.10a, b</a>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The forces of selection worked first in favor, and then against, the melanic forms, and this has clearly been related to industrial pollution. But the idea that melanic forms were favored simply because they were camouflaged against smoke-stained backgrounds may only be part of the story. The moths rest on tree trunks during the day, and nonmelanic moths are well hidden against a background of mosses and lichens. Industrial pollution had not just blackened the moths’ background; atmospheric pollution, especially SO<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub>, had also destroyed most of the moss and lichen on the tree trunks. Indeed the distribution of melanic forms in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0010">Figure 2.10a</a> closely fits the areas in which tree trunks were likely to have lost lichen cover as a result of SO<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> and so ceased to provide such effective camouflage for the nonmelanic moths. Thus, SO<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> pollution may have been as important as smoke in selecting melanic moths, and its amelioration may have been as important in favoring the return of the typicals.</p>

<p class="para">It is easy to see that a population of plants faced with repeated drought is likely to evolve a tolerance of water shortage, and an animal repeatedly faced with cold winters is likely to evolve habits of hibernation or a thick protective coat. But droughts do not become any less severe as a result, nor winters milder. The situation is quite different when two species interact: predator on prey, parasite on host, competitive neighbor on neighbor. Natural selection may select from a population of parasites those that are more efficient at infecting their host. But this immediately sets in play forces of natural selection that favor more resistant hosts. As they evolve, they put further pressure on the ability of the parasite to infect.

<p class="para">We have seen that natural selection can force populations of plants and animals to change their character—to evolve. But none of the examples we have considered has involved the evolution of a new species. Indeed, Darwin’s <span class="txt-italic">On the Origin of Species</span> is about natural selection and evolution: not really about the origin of species. Black and typical peppered moths are forms within a species not different species. Likewise, the zinc-tolerant and zinc-sensitive forms of the grasses at Trelogan mine, and the dull and flamboyant races of guppies, are just local genetic classes. None qualifies for the status of distinct species. So: what criteria justify naming two populations as different species?</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">Cynics have said, with some truth, that a species is what a competent taxonomist regards as a species. Darwin himself regarded species, like many other taxonomic groupings, as ‘merely artificial combinations made for convenience.’ In the 1930s, however, two American biologists, Mayr and Dobzhansky, introduced a now broadly accepted empirical test that could be used to decide whether two populations were part of the same or of two different species. They recognized organisms as being members of a single <span class="txt-bold">species</span> if they could, at least potentially, breed together in nature to produce fertile offspring. They called species tested and defined in this way <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c02-tdef-0006" title="a species for which it has been established (or at least generally agreed) that members of the species can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring but cannot do so with individuals that do not belong to that biospecies" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - biospecies">biospecies</span>. In the examples that we have used earlier in this chapter, we know that melanic and normal peppered moths can mate and that the offspring are fully fertile; this is also true of colored and dull guppies and of zinc-tolerant and zinc-sensitive grass plants. They are all variations within species—not separate species.</p>
<p class="para indent">In practice, however, biologists do not apply the Mayr–Dobzhansky test before they recognize every species: there is simply not enough time and resources. What is more important is that the test recognizes a crucial element in the evolutionary process. Two parts of a population can evolve into distinct species only if some sort of barrier prevents gene flow between them. If the members of two populations are able to hybridize and their genes are combined and reassorted in their progeny, then natural selection can never make them truly distinct.</p>

(Ecological speciation is thus distinct from speciation dominated by chance events, such as the sudden doubling of a chromosome number that occasionally occurs during abnormal cell division.) The source of divergent selection is likely to be either a difference in the environment experienced by different subpopulations or a difference in their interaction with other species. Hence, the most orthodox scenario for speciation comprises a number of stages (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0011">Figure 2.11</a>). First, two subpopulations become geographically isolated and natural selection drives genetic adaptation to their local environments. Next, coincident with but not caused by this genetic differentiation, a degree of reproductive isolation builds up between the two. This may, for example, be a difference in courtship ritual, tending to prevent offspring production in the first place (hence, called ‘pre-zygotic’ isolation), or the hybrid offspring themselves may simply display a reduced fitness, being ‘neither one thing nor the other’ (post-zygotic isolation). Finally, in a phase of secondary contact, the two subpopulations remeet, and natural selection will then favor any feature in either subpopulation that <span class="txt-italic">reinforces</span> reproductive isolation, especially pre-zygotic characteristics, preventing the production of low-fitness hybrid offspring. These breeding barriers then cement the distinction between what have now become separate species.</p>

As time progresses, initially two populations of a species that are neither ecologically different nor reproductively isolated from one another become geographically separated: the start of the allopatric phase. In their now-separate environments, the populations diverge through independent natural selection (the different colored circles) and a degree of reproductive isolation develops. There is subsequently secondary contact between the two populations – the start of the sympatric stage—where strengthened reproductive isolation is favored by natural selection because of the much-reduced fitness of hybrid offspring. However, the dividing line between the allopatric and sympatric stages may be to the extreme right (no secondary contact: no sympatric stage) or, probably more rarely, to the extreme left (no initial allopatric stage but with incipient new species coexisting but living in different microenvironments or engaging in different ecological interactions). <span class="source">(After Rundle &amp; Nosil, 2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0507">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0507</a>-->.)</span></span></div>

We shall see below that even after species have been formed, there may be some exchange of genes between them. For the formation of a new species, like the boiling of an egg, there is some freedom to argue about when it is completed.</p>

<p class="para">As we have already noted, it is when a population becomes split into completely isolated populations, especially when dispersed onto different islands, that they most readily diverge into distinct species. The most celebrated example of speciation on islands is the case of Darwin’s finches in the Galapagos archipelago. The Galapagos are volcanic islands, isolated in the Pacific Ocean about 1000 km west of Equador and 750 km from the island of Cocos, which is itself 500 km from Central America. Above an altitude of 500 m, the vegetation is open grassland. Below this, there is a humid zone of forest and then a coastal strip of desert vegetation with some endemic species of prickly pear cactus (<span class="txt-italic">Opuntia</span>). There is, therefore, a wide variety of habitats on the islands, and 14 different species of finch are found there (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0012">Figure 2.12</a>).</p>

<p class="para indent">Members of one group, including <span class="txt-italic">Geospiza fuliginosa</span> and <span class="txt-italic">G. fortis</span>, have strong bills and hop and scratch for seeds on the ground. <span class="txt-italic">Geospiza scandens</span> has a narrower and slightly longer bill and feeds on the flowers and pulp of the prickly pears as well as on seeds. Finches of a third group have parrot-like bills and feed on leaves, buds, flowers, and fruits, and a fourth group with a parrot-like bill (<span class="txt-italic">Camarhynchus psittacula</span>) has become insectivorous, feeding on beetles and other insects in the canopy of trees. A so-called woodpecker finch, <span class="txt-italic">Camarhynchus</span> (<span class="txt-italic">Cactospiza</span>) <span class="txt-italic">pallida</span>, extracts insects from crevices by holding a spine or a twig in its bill, while yet a further group includes a species (<span class="txt-italic">Certhidea olivacea</span>) that, rather like a warbler, flits around actively and collects small insects in the forest canopy and in the air.</p>
<p class="para indent">There is, though, every reason to suppose that these Galapagos finches evolved and radiated from a single ancestral species that invaded the islands from the mainland of Central America. Despite their separate adaptations, there are strong morphological similarities between them, and indeed, accurate modern tests (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0012">Figure 2.12b</a>)—tracing evolutionary relationships by analyzing variation in ‘microsatellite’ DNA (see <span id="widget-62553" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62553" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 8</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62553"></div>)—confirm the long-held view that the family tree of the Galapagos finches radiated from a single trunk. They also provide strong evidence that the warbler finch (<span class="txt-italic">Certhidea olivacea</span>) was the first to split off from the founding group and is likely to be the most similar to the original colonist ancestors. The entire process of evolutionary divergence of these species appears to have happened in less than 3 million years.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Populations of ancestor species, then, became reproductively isolated, most likely after chance colonization of different islands within the archipelago, and evolved separately for a time. Subsequent movements between islands may then have brought nonhybridizing biospecies together that have evolved to fill different niches. However, the biospecies compartments are not water-tight. A study of the four species on the small island of Daphne Major, and of their possible interbreeding with birds from larger nearby islands, again using microsatellite DNA, is summarized in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0012">Figure 2.12c</a>. It shows that the two most abundant species on the island, <span class="txt-italic">Geospiza fortis</span> and <span class="txt-italic">G. scandens</span>, were subject to a greater flow of genes between one another than they were to genes from immigrants of their own species from other islands. Indeed, in the case of <span class="txt-italic">G. fortis</span>, there was also a substantial flow of genes from <span class="txt-italic">G. fulginosa</span> immigrants from other islands. Once again, therefore, the ‘ideal’ of gene flow within a species but not between them is not borne out by the data. But the fact that there are ‘gray areas’ partway through the process does not diminish the importance of either the process of speciation or the concept of biospecies.</p>

But we have no idea what’s actually living there.’</p>
<p class="para indent">‘Just like the 19th century naturalists used to go to the Galápagos and other islands to find species there that are different to elsewhere and then use that to understand patterns of dispersal and evolution, we can use deep-sea vents to do the same things beneath the waves,’ he said.</p>

<p class="para">evolution in Californian salamanders: ring species</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The fact that speciation is a process rather than an event is further illustrated by the extraordinary case of ring species. In these, races or subspecies of a species that fall short of being full species themselves (i.e., distinct forms that are nonetheless capable of producing fertile hybrids) are arranged along a geographic gradient, but in such a way that the two ends of the gradient themselves meet, hence forming a ring, and where they do, they behave as good species despite being linked, back around the ring, by the series of interbreeding races. Thus, what would normally be a temporal sequence of events, that we can only presume to have happened, becomes frozen in space for us to observe in the here and now. Salamanders of the <span class="txt-italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii</span> species-complex in California provide a good example (Irwin et al., 2001<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0283">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0283</a>-->). There are generally held to be seven subspecies (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0014">Figure 2.14a</a>), following an initial invasion from the north, spreading southwards along the mountain ranges separated by the Central Valley of California. This has led, broadly, to two genetic lineages: <span class="txt-italic">E. eschscholtzii oregonensis</span> (indicating subspecies <span class="txt-italic">oregonensis</span>), <span class="txt-italic">E. e. picta</span>, <span class="txt-italic">E. e. xanthoptica</span>, <span class="txt-italic">E. e. eschscholtzii</span>, and northern populations of <span class="txt-italic">E. e. platensis</span>, on the one hand, and southern populations of <span class="txt-italic">E. e. platensis</span>, <span class="txt-italic">E. e. croceater</span>, and <span class="txt-italic">E. e. klauberi</span> on the other.

Hence, these are two distinct species, which have arisen recently from a common ancestor in a small, isolated patch of homogeneous habitat. There seems little doubt, therefore, that this speciation must have occurred sympatrically, presumably driven by the divergent selection to specialise on bottom-feeding in the one case and on open water-feeding in the other. Interestingly, one of the most staggeringly rich examples of <span class="txt-bold">endemism</span>, the occurrence together of many endemic species, is also provided by cichlid fish: those of the East African Great Lakes, with more than 1,500 endemic species. It remains to be discovered how important a role sympatric speciation plays in that case, and whether divergent selection to different niches is the main driving force.<p></p>

<p class="para">It is tempting to translate our confidence in the power of natural selection into a belief that each species represents the best possible adaptation to the environment in which it finds itself. We should resist that temptation. Techniques for analyzing and dating biological remains (particularly buried pollen) increasingly allow us to detect just how much of the present distribution of organisms is a precise locally evolved match to present environments, and how much is a fingerprint left by the hand of history. Changes in climate, particularly during the ice ages of the Pleistocene (the past 2–3 million years), bear much of the responsibility for the present distributions of plants and animals. As climates have changed, species populations have advanced and retreated, been fragmented into isolated patches, and may then have rejoined. Much of what we see in the present distribution of species represents a phase in the recovery from past climatic change.</p>

<p class="para indent">During the 20,000 years since the peak of the last glaciation, global temperatures have risen by about 8°C. The analysis of buried pollen—particularly of woody species, which produce most of the pollen—can show how vegetation has changed during this period (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0016">Figure 2.16b</a>). As the ice retreated, different forest species advanced in different ways and at different speeds.

<p class="para indent">We do not have such good records for the postglacial spread of the animals associated with the changing forests, but it is at least certain that many species could not have spread faster than the trees on which they feed.

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The records of climatic change in the tropics are far less complete than those for temperate regions. It has been suggested, though, that during cooler, drier glacial periods, the tropical forests retreated to smaller patches, surrounded by a sea of savanna, within which speciation was intense, giving rise to present-day ‘hot-spots’ of endemism. Support for this in, for example, the Amazonian rain forest now seems less certain than it once did, but there is support for the idea in other regions. In the Australian Wet Tropics of Queensland, northeastern Australia, it has been possible to use present-day distributions of forest to predict distributions in the cool-dry climate of the last Glacial Maximum when forest-contraction was greatest (about 18,000 years ago), the cool-wet period around 7,000 years ago when a massive expansion was likely, and the warm-wet period around 4,000 years ago when there was likely to have been another contraction (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0018">Figure 2.18a</a>; Graham et al., 2006<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0209">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0209</a>-->).

But the scales are quite different. Postglacial warming of about 8°C occurred over around 20,000 years—0.04°C per century, compared to the current rate of global warming of 1.75°C per century, and changes in the vegetation failed to keep pace even with this. But current projections for the 21st century require range shifts for trees at rates of 300–500 km per century compared to typical rates in the past of 20–40 km per century (and exceptional rates of 100–150 km).

Eventually, however, measurements of the directions of the Earth’s magnetic fields required the same, apparently wildly improbable, explanation and the critics capitulated. The discovery that the tectonic plates of the Earth’s crust move and carry the migrating continents with them reconciles geologist and biologist (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0019">Figure 2.19</a>).

<p class="para indent">The established drift of large land masses over the face of the Earth explains many patterns in the distribution of species that would otherwise be difficult to understand. One classic example is provided by the placental and marsupial mammals. Marsupials arrived on what would become the Australian continent in the Cretaceous period (around 90 million years ago; see <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c02-fig-0019">Figure 2.19</a>), when the only other mammals present were the curious egg-laying monotremes (now represented only by the spiny anteaters and the duck-billed platypus). The splitting away of Australia, however, prevented the invasion of placental mammals once they had evolved on other, now quite separate continents. An evolutionary process of radiation then occurred among the Australian marsupials that in many ways paralleled what was occurring among the placental mammals on other continents (<span id="widget-62564" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62564" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 2.20</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62564"></div>). It is hard to escape the view that the geographically separate environments of the placentals and marsupials contained similar ecological pigeonholes (niches) into which the evolutionary process has neatly ‘fitted’ ecological equivalents. Because they started to diversify from a common ancestral line, and both inherited a common set of potentials and constraints, we refer to this as <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c02-tdef-0011" title="the evolution along similar lines of systematic groups that had been separated geographically at an earlier stage in their history" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - parallel evolution">parallel evolution</span>.

<p class="para">Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace independently proposed that natural selection constituted a force that would drive a process of evolution. The theory of natural selection is an ecological theory. The reproductive potential of living organisms leads them inescapably to compete for limited resources. Success in this competition is measured by leaving more descendants than others to subsequent generations. When these ancestors differ in properties that are heritable, the character of populations will necessarily change over time and evolution will happen. Natural selection is a result of events in the past—it has no intentions and no aim.</p>

<p class="para">It seems quite natural to describe environmental conditions as ‘extreme,’ ‘harsh,’ ‘benign,’ or ‘stressful.’ But these describe how we, human beings, feel about them. It may seem obvious when conditions are extreme: the midday heat of a desert, the cold of an Antarctic winter, the salt concentration of the Great Salt Lake. What this means, however, is only that these conditions are extreme <span class="txt-italic">for us</span>, given our particular physiological characteristics and tolerances. But to a cactus there is nothing extreme about the desert conditions in which cacti have evolved; nor are the icy fastnesses of Antarctica an extreme environment for penguins. But a tropical rain forest <span class="txt-italic">would</span> be a harsh environment for a penguin, though it is benign for a tropical bird such as a macaw; and a lake is a harsh environment for a cactus, though it is benign for a water hyacinth. There is, then, a relativity in the ways organisms respond to conditions; it is too easy and dangerous for the ecologist to assume that all other organisms sense the environment in the way we do. Emotive words like <span class="txt-italic">harsh</span> and <span class="txt-italic">benign</span>, even relativities such as <span class="txt-italic">hot</span> and <span class="txt-italic">cold</span>, should be used by ecologists only with care.</p>

Different organisms will have different response curves, with for instance the optimum temperature for a penguin being considerably less than that for a macaw. For each species, an organism may be able to survive over a wide range of temperatures, but might grow actively only over a more restricted range and might reproduce only within an even narrower band. We can draw similar response curves for other conditions, such as pH, soil moisture, or water salinity.

However, at excessively high temperatures, biological processes will stop increasing in rate, and eventually will even fall or stop, due, for instance, to denaturing of proteins (as in cooking). Of greater importance from an ecological standpoint, effects on individual chemical reactions are often less important than effects on rates of growth or development or on final body size, since these tend to drive the core ecological activities of survival, reproduction, and movement (see <span id="widget-62573" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62573" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62573"></div>). And when we plot rates of growth and development of whole organisms against the organism’s temperature, we commonly observe an extended near-linear range (<span id="widget-62574" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62574" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 3.2b, c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62574"></div></span>), again up to some level at which temperature becomes excessive. At lower body temperatures (though ‘lower’ varies from species to species, as explained earlier), performance is likely to be impaired simply as a result of metabolic inactivity.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">These effects of temperature on growth, development, and size can be of practical importance in addition to academic interest. Increasingly, ecologists are called upon to predict. We may wish to know what the consequences would be, say, of a 2°C rise in global temperatures.

<p class="para">high and low temperatures</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">At extremely high temperatures, enzymes and other proteins become unstable and break down, and the organism dies. But difficulties may set in before these extremes are reached. At high temperatures, terrestrial organisms may be cooled by the evaporation of water (from open stomata on the surfaces of leaves, or through sweating), but this may lead to serious, perhaps lethal, problems of dehydration. Even where loss of water is not a problem, for example, among aquatic organisms, death is usually inevitable if temperatures are maintained for long above 60°C. The exceptions, <span class="txt-bold">thermophiles</span>, are mostly specialized fungi, bacteria, and archaea. One of these, <span class="txt-italic">Pyrodictium occultum</span>, can live at 105°C —something that is only possible because, under the pressure of the deep ocean where it lives, water does not boil at that temperature.</p>
<p class="para indent">At body temperatures a few degrees above zero Celsius, organisms may be forced into extended periods of inactivity, and the cell membranes of sensitive species may begin to break down. This is known as <span class="txt-bold">chilling injury</span>, which affects many tropical fruits. On the other hand, many species of both plants and animals can tolerate temperatures well below zero provided that ice does not form. If it is not disturbed, water can supercool to temperatures as low as−40°C without forming ice; but a sudden shock allows ice to form quite suddenly within plant cells, and this, rather than the low temperature itself, is then lethal, since ice formed within a cell is likely simply to disrupt and destroy it. If, however, temperatures fall slowly, ice can form between cells and draw water from within them. With dehydrated cells, the effects on plants are then very much like those of high temperature drought. Many animal species have adaptations to withstand body temperatures below zero: for instance, mussels of the species <span class="txt-italic">Mytilis edulis</span>, when living in an intertidal area at low temperatures, produce antifreeze to prevent freezing when they are out in the air at low tide.</p>

<p class="para">the timing of extremes</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">The absolute temperature that an organism experiences is important. But the timing and duration of temperature extremes may be equally important. For example, unusually hot days in early spring may interfere with fish spawning or kill the fry but otherwise leave the adults unaffected. Similarly, a late spring frost might kill seedlings but leave saplings and larger trees unaffected. The duration and frequency of extreme conditions are also often critical. In many cases, a periodic drought or tropical storm may have a greater effect on a species’ distribution than the average level of a condition. To take just one example: the saguaro cactus is liable to be killed when temperatures remain below freezing for 36 hours, but if there is a daily thaw, it is under no threat. In Arizona, the northern and eastern edges of the cactus’s distribution correspond to a line joining places where on occasional days it fails to thaw. Thus, the saguaro is absent where there are occasionally lethal conditions—an individual need only be killed once.</p>

<p class="para indent">The idea that animals and plants in nature can anticipate, and be used by us to predict, future conditions (‘a big crop of berries means a harsh winter to come’) is the stuff of folklore. But there are important advantages to an organism that can predict and prepare for repeated events such as the seasons. For this, the organism needs an internal clock that can be used to check against an external signal. The most widely used external signal is the length of the period of daylight within the daily cycle—the <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c03-tdef-0002" title="length of the period of daylight each day" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - photoperiod">photoperiod</span>.

<p class="para">Although organisms respond to each condition in their environment, the effects of conditions may be determined largely by the responses of other community members. Temperature, for example, does not act on one species alone: it also acts on its competitors, prey, parasites, and so on. Most especially, an organism will suffer if its food is another species that cannot tolerate an environmental condition. This result is illustrated by the distribution of the rush moth (<span class="txt-italic">Coleophora alticolella</span>) in England. The moth lays its eggs on the flowers of the rush (<span class="txt-italic">Juncus squarrosus</span>) and the caterpillars feed on the developing seeds. Above 600 m, the moths and caterpillars are little affected by the direct effects of low temperatures, but the rush, although it grows, fails to ripen its seeds. This, in turn, limits the distribution of the moth, because caterpillars that hatch in the colder elevations will starve as a result of insufficient food (Randall, 1982<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0481">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0481</a>-->).</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">In temperate, boreal, arctic, and even many tropical environments, physical conditions follow a seasonal cycle, and organisms cope with this seasonality through a variety of mechanisms. Indeed, there has long been a fascination with organisms’ responses to the seasons (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fea-0001">Box 3.1</a>). Morphological and physiological characteristics can never be ideal for all phases in the cycle, and the jack-of-all-trades is master of none. One solution is for the morphological and physiological characteristics to keep changing with the seasons (or even anticipating them, as in acclimatization). But change may be costly: a deciduous tree may have leaves ideal for life in summer but faces the cost of making new ones every year. An alternative is to economize by having long-lasting leaves like those of pines, heathers, and the perennial shrubs of deserts. Here, though, there is a cost to be paid in the form of more sluggish physiological processes. Different species have evolved different compromise solutions.</p>

<p class="para indent">Despite these overlaps, endothermy is inherently a different strategy from ectothermy. Over a certain narrow temperature range, an endotherm consumes energy at a basal rate. But at environmental temperatures further above or below that zone, endotherms expend increasingly more energy to maintain their constant body temperature. This makes them relatively independent of environmental conditions and allows them to stay longer at or close to peak performance. It makes them more effective in both searching for food and escaping from predators. However, there is a cost—a high requirement for food to fuel this strategy.</p>
<p class="para indent">The idea that organisms are harmed (and limited in their distributions) not ‘directly’ by environmental conditions, but because of the energetic costs required to tolerate those conditions, is illustrated by a study examining the effect of a different condition: salinity. Two freshwater shrimp species, <span class="txt-italic">Palaemonetes pugio</span> and <span class="txt-italic">P. vulgaris</span>, co-occur in estuaries on the eastern coast of the United States at a wide range of salinities, but the former is more tolerant of lower salinities than the latter, occupying some habitats from which the latter is absent. <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0012">Figure 3.12</a> shows the mechanism likely to be underlying this.

<p class="para indent">Endotherms have morphological modifications that reduce their energetic costs. In cold climates most have low surface area to volume ratios (short ears and limbs), which reduces heat loss through surfaces. Typically, endotherms that live in polar environments are insulated from the cold with extremely dense fur (polar bears, mink, foxes) or feathers and extra layers of fat. In contrast, desert endotherms often have thin fur, and long ears and limbs, which help dissipate heat.</p>

<p class="para indent">Variability of conditions can be as great a biological challenge as are extremes. Seasonal cycles, for example, can expose an animal to summer heat close to its thermal maximum, and winter chill close to its thermal minimum. Responses to these changing conditions include the laying down of different coats in the fall (thick and underlain by a thick fat layer) and in the spring (a thinner coat and loss of the dense fat layer) (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0013">Figure 3.13</a>).

The rate of photosynthesis increases with the intensity of the radiation that a leaf receives, but with diminishing returns; and this relationship itself varies greatly between species (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0014">Figure 3.14</a>), especially between those that usually live in shaded habitats (which reach saturation at low radiation intensities) and those that normally experience full sunlight and can take advantage of it.

<p class="para indent">The solar radiation that reaches a plant or algal cell is forever changing. Its angle and intensity change in a regular and systematic way annually, diurnally and with depth within the canopy or in a water body (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0015">Figure 3.15</a>). In aquatic ecosystems, the reduction of light with depth varies greatly depending upon such things as the amount of algae and suspended clay in the water. There are also irregular, unsystematic variations due to changes in cloud cover or shadowing by the leaves of neighboring plants. As light flecks pass over leaves lower in the canopy, they receive seconds or minutes of direct bright light and then plunge back into shade. As algae and cyanobacteria are mixed up and down through the surface waters of a lake or ocean, they constantly see a different amount of light radiation. The daily photosynthesis of a leaf or algal cell integrates these various experiences. A whole plant integrates the diverse exposure of its various leaves.</p>

<p class="para indent">There is enormous variation in the shapes and sizes of leaves. Most of the heritable variation in shape has probably evolved under selection not primarily for high photosynthesis, but rather for factors such as optimal efficiency of water use (photosynthesis achieved per unit of water transpired), minimization of the damage done by foraging animals, and reducing the likelihood of overheating. Not all the variations in leaf shape are heritable, though: many are responses by the individual to its immediate environment. Many trees, especially, produce different types of leaf in positions exposed to full sunlight (‘sun leaves’) and in places lower in the canopy where they are shaded (‘shade leaves’). Sun leaves are thicker, with more densely packed chloroplasts (which process the incoming radiation) within cells and more cell layers. The more flimsy shade leaves intercept diffused and filtered radiation low in the canopy but may nonetheless supplement the main photosynthetic activity of the sun leaves high in the canopy.</p>

Sun-plant leaves are inclined at a much steeper angle to the horizontal, and therefore absorb the direct rays of the overhead summer sun over a wider leaf area than the more horizontal shade-plant leaves. The more angled leaves of sun plants, though, are also less likely than shade-plant leaves to shade other leaves of the same plant from the overhead rays of the summer sun (<span id="widget-62580" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62580" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 3.16c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62580"></div></span>). But in winter, when the sun is much lower in the sky, it is the shade plants that are much less subject to this self-shading. As a result, the proportion of incident radiation intercepted per unit area of leaf is higher in shade than in sun plants year round, in summer because of the more horizontal leaves and in winter because of the relative absence of self-shading.<p></p>

Some water is also consumed in photosynthesis, with the hydrogen incorporated into organic matter.

This can only happen across surfaces that are wet—most notably the walls of the photosynthesizing cells in leaves. If a leaf allows carbon dioxide to enter, some water vapor also leaves. Likewise, any mechanism that slows down the rate of water loss, such as closing the stomata (pores) on the leaf surface, will reduce the rate of carbon dioxide absorption and hence reduce the rate of photosynthesis.</p>

Other species may have a strategy to replace the shed leaves with new leaf forms that are less extravagant of water.</p>

<p class="para">increasing the efficiency of water use: the C4 approach</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Specialized biochemical processes may increase the amount of photosynthesis that can be achieved per unit of water lost. The majority of plants on Earth, and all algae and photosynthetic bacteria, photosynthesize using what is termed the <span class="txt-bold">C3 pathway</span>: their first product of photosynthesis is a sugar containing three carbon atoms. Although these plants are highly productive photosynthesizers, they are relatively wasteful of water, reach their maximum rates of photosynthesis at relatively low intensities of radiation, and are less successful in arid areas. Of course, this is no problem for photosynthetic organisms in lakes and oceans, where water availability is never an issue!</p>
<p class="para indent">One alternative approach to photosynthesis, the <span class="txt-bold">C4 pathway</span>, produces a four-carbon sugar as the initial product. Plants with the C4 pathway are far more efficient in their use of carbon dioxide, and therefore in their use of water as well: they do not need to leave their stomata open as much to get carbon dioxide, and so less water escapes. C4 photosynthesis evolved more recently than the C3 process (perhaps 30 million years ago, but not becoming ecologically significant until 6 to 7 million years ago), and it is still relatively rare among species: only 3% of terrestrial plants are C4, and most of these are grasses. Nonetheless, C4 plants can be astonishingly productive, and are thought to make up almost 30% of all photosynthesis by terrestrial plants globally (Osborne &amp; Beerling, 2006<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0443">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0443</a>-->).

On the other hand, C4 photosynthesis is inefficient at low radiation intensities, making C4 plants poor shade plants. Several globally important agricultural crops that do well in hot and dry conditions, such as corn, sugar cane, and sweet sorghum, are C4 plants. It is interesting to note that the dominant grass in North America salt marshes, <span class="txt-italic">Spartina alterniflora</span>, is a C4 grass. Even though the roots of these grasses are always submerged, they are submerged in seawater. During transpiration, the salt of the seawater accumulates in the leaves, and the plants expends significant energy extruding the salt as crystals from the blades. C4 metabolism makes sense for <span class="txt-italic">Spartina</span> as a way to conserve the water that is transpired.</p>

<p class="para">obtaining water from the soil</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Almost all falling water (rain, snow, etc.) bypasses the plants and passes to the soil. Some drains through the soil, but much is held against gravity by capillary forces and as colloids. Terrestrial plants obtain virtually all their water from this stored reserve. Sandy soils have wide pores: these do not hold much water but what is there is held with weak forces and plants can withdraw it easily. Clay soils have very fine pores. They retain more water against the force of gravity, but surface tension in the fine pores makes it more difficult for the plants to withdraw it. The primary water-absorbing zone on roots is covered with root hairs that make intimate contact with soil particles. As water is withdrawn from the soil, the first to be released is from the wider pores, where capillary forces retain it only weakly. Subsequent water is withdrawn from narrower paths in which the water is more tightly held. Consequently, the more the soil around the roots is depleted of water, the more resistance there is to water flow. As a result of water withdrawal, roots create water depletion zones (or, more generally, resource depletion zones or RDZs) around themselves. The faster the roots draw water from the soil, the more sharply defined the RDZs, and the more slowly water will move into that zone. In a soil that contains abundant water, rapidly transpiring plants may still wilt because water does not flow fast enough to replenish the RDZs around their root systems (or because the roots cannot explore new soil volumes fast enough).</p>

<p class="para indent">Root architecture is important in this process, because different nutrients behave differently and are held in the soil by different forces. Nitrate ions, the major form of nitrogen for many plants, diffuse readily in soil water. However, other key nutrients such as phosphate (the major form of phosphorus for plant uptake) and ammonium (another form of nitrogen often used by plants) are tightly bound in the soil, often through adsorption to mineral surfaces or in clay lattice structures. The phosphate RDZs of two roots 0.2 mm apart scarcely overlap, and the parts of a finely branched root system scarcely compete with each other. Consequently, if phosphate is in short supply, a highly branched surface root will greatly improve phosphate absorption. A more widely spaced extensive root system, in contrast, will tend to maximize access to nitrate.</p>

In both lake and ocean water, nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate all diffuse to these cell surfaces at similar rates, since there is no soil to bind the nutrients. Architecture is quite important, though. In ocean waters where nutrient concentrations are very low, very small algal species dominate: smaller cells have a greater surface area compared to their volume, and so the small size maximizes the rate of nutrient uptake across the surface area of the cell per volume of cell. In aquatic ecosystems where nutrient concentrations are higher, species with larger cells dominate. These have more chlorophyll per volume of cell, and can therefore photosynthesize and grow more rapidly, and less surface area per volume is necessary for sufficient nutrient uptake.</p>

Carbon dioxide varies in its concentration at a variety of scales. Globally, the concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing over time. In 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were approximately 280 µl l<sup class="txt-sup default">−1</sup> (parts per million, or ppm). Since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the concentration has grown exponentially, driven both by the carbon lost to the atmosphere as forests are cleared and even more so by the burning of fossil fuels.

While the carbon dioxide concentrations were much higher yet further back in the geological past, the current levels are the highest seen in many millions of years.

<p class="para indent">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and issues periodic reports on the current scientific understanding of the global climate system, providing estimates of future change and highlighting areas of uncertainty. The most recent synthesis report from the IPCC (2013) reflects the consensus work of over 3,000 expert scientists from over 130 countries. The report concludes that the Earth has indeed been warming over the past several decades (&gt; 99% probability), that this warming is very likely a result of the increase of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (&gt; 90% probability), and that continued release of greenhouse gases is very likely to result in further warming well beyond that already observed (&gt; 90% probability). On average, the planet is now 0.7°C warmer than in the early 20th century, and the current rate of warming is probably the greatest the Earth has ever experienced. If current trends continue, the average temperature is expected to rise to 1.5°C above the early 20th-century baseline by 2030, and to 2°C above by 2045, with continued increases beyond then (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0020">Figure 3.20</a>). At this level of global warming, many models predict severe consequences, including more extremes and much greater variability in weather, possible decreases in the global capacity to grow food, and the possibility of passing one or more tipping points in the climate system that could result in even more rapid warming (with less ability for humans to control it).</p>

<p class="para indent">Do higher concentrations of carbon dioxide encourage faster plant growth? When other resources are present at adequate levels, additional carbon dioxide scarcely influences the rate of photosynthesis of C4 plants but can dramatically increase the rate of C3 plants. Indeed, artificially increasing the carbon dioxide concentration in greenhouses is a commercial technique to increase crop yields of C3 plants. We might reasonably predict dramatic increases in the productivity of individual plants, and of whole crops and natural ecosystems, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to increase, and in fact some scientists have made such projections. However, the responses of natural ecosystems are more complicated than that of individual plants grown under ideal conditions in a greenhouse, in part because other resources are often not present at adequate levels. For instance, a low availability of nitrogen may keep a forest from responding to higher levels of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class="para indent">Ecologists began a series of experiments in the 1990s to evaluate the consequences of elevated carbon dioxide on the dynamics of the community and ecosystem—not just the response of individual plants—by artificially increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the local environment over a scale of a few hundred square meters. By now, we have observations from a large number of such whole-ecosystem experiments in a variety of different types of systems, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural fields. It turns out that the variation in response across ecosystems is high, yet some generalities emerge. Any increase in production of agricultural cereal crops (maize or corn, wheat) is much less than would be predicted from studies of individual plants. On the other hand, forest plots responded much more to carbon dioxide than did crops, and the responses were more in line with predictions from smaller-scale experiments (Ainsworth &amp; Long, 2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0003">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0003</a>-->). It is essential that we continue to try to determine the long-term consequences of increased carbon dioxide on photosynthesis at the community and ecosystem scale. To do so, we need to consider not only the direct physiological response to the carbon dioxide, but the interactions with water and nutrient availability, and also the possible influences from changes in herbivores (as the character of leaf tissues change), the influences of floods and of droughts, and factors such as changes in ozone toxicity to plants that may increase as temperatures rise.</p>

<p class="para indent">Another fascinating type of organisms are the autotrophs which get their energy by oxidizing the reduced energy found in inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfides. These chemo-autotrophic bacteria use this energy (generally using oxygen to oxidize the reduced chemical compound) to fix carbon dioxide into organic matter using the same basic enzymes as in C3 photosynthesis. The energy source is different—reduced chemical substances rather than light—but the rest of the autotrophy is similar, resulting in new biomass of living bacteria. This process can be locally important as a source of new organic production in some ecosystems, including many wetlands and some lakes and coastal marine ecosystems. But globally, the process is dwarfed by photosynthesis.</p>

<p class="para indent">Killer whales are an example of a predator, but the relationship encompasses a much wider array of consumer–resource interactions. For example, a squirrel is a predator when it eats an acorn (it kills the acorn embryo), and a planktonic crustacean is a predator when it eats an algal cell (even though many ecologists might informally call this consumption of algae “grazing”). In both cases, the predator kills its food resource as it consumes it.</p>
<p class="para indent">Of course, nature can always confound simple distinctions. While lions might seem the premier example of a predator, much of their food comes from eating animals killed by others: they are both predators and decomposers. As an example of even greater complexity, JoAnn Burkholder and colleagues discovered a whole new genus of organisms in 1988: <span class="txt-italic">Pfiesteria</span>.

<p class="para indent">Some animals have very specialized diets, while others are generalists. The generalists feed on a wide variety of foods, although they very often have clear preferences and a rank order of what they will choose when there are alternatives available. Some specialists may focus on particular parts of their prey but range over a number of species. This is most common among herbivores because, as we shall see, different parts of plants are quite different in their composition. Thus, many birds specialize on eating seeds, though they are seldom restricted to a particular species. Other consumers may specialize on a single species or a narrow range of closely related species. Examples are caterpillars of the cinnabar moth (which eat the leaves, flower buds, and very young stems of a species of ragwort, <span class="txt-italic">Senecio</span>) and many species of host-specific parasites.</p>

The richest concentrations of plant proteins (and hence of nitrogen) are in the meristem in the buds at shoot tips and in leaf axils. Not surprisingly, these are usually heavily protected with bud scales and defended from herbivores by prickles and spines. Seeds are usually dried, packaged reserves rich in starch or oils as well as specialized storage proteins. And the very sugary and fleshy fruits are resources provided by the plant as ‘payment’ to animals that disperse the seeds. Very little of the plants’ nitrogen is spent on these rewards.</p>

<p class="para">from plants into animals</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">For a consumer, the body of a plant is a quite different package of resources from the body of an animal. First, plant cells are bounded by walls of cellulose, lignin, and other structural carbohydrates that give plants their high-fiber content and contribute to their high ratio of carbon to other elements. These large amounts of fixed carbon mean that plants are potentially rich sources of energy, although they are protein-poor. Yet the overwhelming majority of animal species lack cellulolytic and other enzymes that can digest these compounds: they are quite useless as a direct energy resource for most herbivores. Moreover, the cell wall material of plants hinders the access of digestive enzymes to the plant cell contents. The acts of chewing by the grazing mammal, cooking by humans, and grinding in the gizzard of birds are necessary precursors to digestion of plant food because they allow digestive enzymes access to the cell contents. The carnivore, by contrast, can more safely gulp its food.</p>
<p class="para indent">Many herbivores have made up for their own lack of cellulolytic enzymes by entering into a <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c03-tdef-0017" title="An interaction between the individuals of two (or more) species in which the growth, growth rate, and/or population size of both are increased in a reciprocal association. (See also Facultative mutualism and Obligate mutualism.)" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - mutualistic">mutualistic</span> association – one that is beneficial to both parties—with cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa in their guts that do have the appropriate enzymes. The rumen (or sometimes the cecum) of many herbivorous mammals is a temperature-regulated culture chamber for these microbes into which already partially fragmented plant tissues flow continually. The microbes receive a home and a supply of food. The herbivorous ‘host’ benefits by absorbing many of the major by-products of this microbial fermentation, especially fatty acids.</p>
<p class="para indent">Unlike plants, animal tissues contain no structural carbohydrate or fiber component but are rich in fat and protein. The C : N ratio of plant tissues commonly exceeds 40 : 1, and is often far higher. In contrast, the ratios rarely exceed 8 : 1 in bacteria, fungi, and animals. Thus, herbivores on plants, which undertake the first stage of making animal bodies out of the plants, are involved in a massive burning off of carbon as the C : N ratio is lowered. The main waste products of herbivores are therefore carbon-rich compounds (carbon dioxide and fiber). Carnivores, on the other hand, get most of their energy from the protein and fats of their prey, and their main excretory products are consequently nitrogenous.</p>
<p class="para indent">The composition of algae is quite different from that of plants, making a very different food resource. Algae have very little structural material, as they are supported by the water in which they live. They are composed largely of chlorophyll, enzymes, and other proteins, held within a cell wall, which explains their low C : N ratio. Herbivores feeding on algae have a much more protein-rich diet than those feeding on plants. Their main waste products will be lower in carbon and richer in nitrogen.</p>
<p class="para indent">Even if the structural component of plants is excluded from consideration, the C : N ratio is high in plants compared with other organisms. Aphids, which gain direct access to cell contents by driving their stylets into the phloem transport system, gain a resource that is rich in soluble sugars (see <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0024">Figure 3.24a</a>). In their search for valuable nitrogen, they use only a fraction of this energy resource and excrete the rest in sugary rich honeydew that may drip as a rain from an aphid-infested tree. For most herbivores and decomposers, the body of a plant is a superabundant source of energy and carbon; it is other components of the diet, especially nitrogen, that are more usually limiting.</p>

In terms of protein, carbohydrate, fat, water, and minerals per gram, there is very little to choose between a diet of caterpillars or cod, or of earthworms, shrimps, or venison. The packages may be differently assembled (and the taste may be different), but the contents are essentially the same. Moreover, the different parts of an animal have very similar nutritional content. Unlike herbivores on plants, carnivores are not faced with difficult problems of digestion (and they vary very little in their digestive apparatus) but rather with difficulties in finding, catching, and overcoming the defenses of their prey.</p>

<p class="para">The value of a resource to a consumer is determined not only by what it contains but by how well its contents are defended. Not surprisingly, organisms have evolved physical, chemical, morphological, and behavioral defenses against being attacked. These serve to reduce the chance of an encounter with a consumer and/or increase the chance of survival in such encounters. The spiny leaves of holly are not eaten by larvae of the oak eggar moth, but if the spines are removed, the leaves are eaten quite readily. No doubt similar results would be achieved in equivalent experiments with foxes as predators and de-spined hedgehogs or porcupines as prey. On a smaller scale, many plant surfaces are clothed in epidermal hairs (trichomes) that may keep the smaller predators (such as thrips and mites) away from the leaf surface (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c03-fig-0026">Figure 3.26</a>).</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">Noxious plant chemicals have been classified into two broad types. The first are <span class="txt-italic">quantitative</span> chemicals (so-called because they are most effective at relatively high concentrations), which make the tissues that contain them, such as mature oak leaves, relatively indigestible. They are also often called <span class="txt-bold">constitutive</span> chemicals, since they tend to be produced even in the absence of herbivore attack. The second type are toxic or <span class="txt-italic">qualitative</span> chemicals, which are poisonous even in small quantities but can be produced relatively rapidly and are therefore commonly <span class="txt-bold">inducible</span>: produced only in response to damage itself, and hence with lower fixed costs to the plants.</p>
<p class="para indent">Plants differ in their chemical defenses from species to species and also from tissue to tissue within an individual plant. Broadly, relatively short-lived, ephemeral plants gain a measure of protection from consumers because of the unpredictability of their appearance in space and time. They therefore need to invest less in defense than predictable, long-lived species like forest trees. The latter, precisely because they are apparent for long periods to a large number of herbivores, tend to invest in constitutive chemicals that, while costly, afford them broad protection, whereas ephemeral plants tend to produce inducible toxins as required. Moreover, it may be predicted that, within an individual plant, the more important plant parts should be protected by costly, constitutive chemicals, whereas less important parts should rely on inducible toxins (McKey, 1979<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0402">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0402</a>-->; Strauss et al., 2004<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0561">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0561</a>-->).

Flower petals are known to be highly important to fitness in this insect-pollinated plant, and concentrations of toxic glucosinolates were twice as high in petals as in undamaged leaves: levels were maintained constitutively, irrespective of whether the petals were damaged by the caterpillars. Leaves, on the other hand, have a much less direct influence on fitness: high levels of leaf damage can be sustained without any measurable effect on reproductive output. Constitutive levels of glucosinolates, as already noted, were low; but if leaves were damaged, the (induced) concentrations were even higher than in the petals.</p>

<p class="para">chemical defense in animals</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Animals have more options than plants when it comes to defending themselves, but some still make use of chemicals. For example, defensive secretions of sulfuric acid of pH 1 or 2 occur in some marine gastropod groups, including the cowries. Other animals, which can tolerate the chemical defenses of their plant food, actually store the plant toxins and use them in their own defense. A classic example is the monarch butterfly, whose caterpillars feed on milkweeds, which contain cardiac glycosides, which are poisonous to mammals and birds. These caterpillars can store the poison, and it is still present in the adult. Thus, a blue jay will vomit violently after eating one, and, once it recovers, will reject all other monarch caterpillars on sight for some time. In contrast, monarch caterpillars reared on cabbage are edible.</p>
<p class="para indent">Chemical defenses are not equally effective against all consumers. Indeed, what is unacceptable to some animals may be the chosen, even unique, diet of others. Many herbivores, particularly insects, specialize on one or a few plant species whose particular defense they have overcome. For example, females of the cabbage root fly, with eggs to lay, home in on a brassica crop from distances as far as 15 m downwind of the plants. It is probably hydrolyzed glucosinolates (toxic to many other species) that provide the attractive odor.</p>

Cryptic animals may be highly palatable, but their morphological traits and color (and their choice of the appropriate background) reduce the likelihood that they will be seen and used as a resource.

Animals that withdraw to a prepared retreat (rabbits and prairie dogs to their burrows, snails to their shells) or roll up and protect their vulnerable parts by a tough exterior (armadillos, hedgehogs) reduce their chance of capture. In the ocean, many zooplankton species will migrate vertically in the water column over the day, going into deeper and darker waters during the day, so they are less easily eaten by visually searching fish, and coming up to shallow surface waters at night to feed, as the algae they feed upon are much more common there.

Two grass plants may compete, and each may be adversely affected by the presence of close neighbors, but this is most likely to be because their resource depletion zones overlap—each may shade its neighbors from the incoming flow of radiation, and water or nutrients may be less accessible than they would otherwise be around the plants’ roots.

The climate and currents, in turn, lead to readily recognizable patterns of life—biomes—over large spatial scales on both the continents and in the oceans. On land, the biomes are structured along gradients of temperature and precipitation. In the oceans, biomes are structured by gradients in the availability of light and of nutrients.</p>

<p class="para indent">Not surprisingly, because of its influence on both conditions and resources, climate plays a dominant role in determining the large-scale distribution of different types of communities and ecosystems across the terrestrial face of the Earth. However, local factors such as soil type are responsible for variation and patchiness in communities and ecosystems on much smaller scales. It is worth remembering, then, that the Earth’s surface would consist of a mosaic of different environments even if climate were identical everywhere. As we shall see repeatedly below, variations critical to the ecological community occur at a whole range of scales, from the global to the very local. For life in the ocean, the interplay of wind and currents is as important as the climate in determining the distribution of types of ecosystems, in part because water is very effective at absorbing heat and buffering temperatures, so the variation in temperature in the oceans is far less than on land. Of course, the moisture gradient of climate that is so important to terrestrial life has little influence on life in the oceans.</p>

<p class="para">Climate controls life, but what controls climate?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">At the largest scale, the geography of life on the Earth’s land masses is mainly a consequence of climate. Climate, in turn, is controlled primarily by the differential heating of the planet by sunlight across the planet, and secondarily by the interaction of the atmosphere with the oceans and with mountain ranges. At the time of the equinoxes in September and March, solar radiation hits the Equator at exactly 90°, while sunlight further north and south hits the Earth’s surface at increasingly oblique angles. Consequently, the amount of solar radiation hitting the surface per unit area is much higher in the tropics, leading to greater heating there (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0001">Figure 4.1</a>). This greater heating leads to warmer temperatures at the Equator, but the heat does not just accumulate there. Rather, it is redistributed across the planet to temperate and polar regions in movements either of air masses in the atmosphere (about 60% of the redistribution) or of water masses, currents, in the oceans (the remaining 40%).</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Redistribution of heat through atmospheric movement</h2>
<p class="para">The movement of heat through the atmosphere is particularly important for the pattern of climate we observe across the Earth’s surface. The heated air at the Equator rises in the atmosphere, cooling as it does so, and at a height of 10 to 15 km above the Earth’s surface begins to move north and south. The air that has risen from the surface is displaced by other air from further north and south that flows towards the Equator along the ground (creating winds and weather on the surface). As the air at 10 to 15 km height reaches latitudes approximately 30° north and south, it descends to the surface, replacing the air that has moved along the surface towards the Equator and completing an atmospheric cycle referred to as the Hadley Cells (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0002">Figure 4.2</a>).</p>

The Hadley cells move heat away from the Equator, and the Polar cells move heat towards the poles. The Ferrel cells are created by the interaction of the Hadley and Polar cells. Because of the Coriolis effect, the surface winds of the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells are diverted to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. As a result, the prevailing surface winds blow from the east in the tropics and in polar regions and from the west in temperate latitudes.</span></div>

<p class="para indent">Closer to the poles, similar atmospheric circulations – the Polar Cells – dominate, driven by rising, warmer air masses at latitudes 60° north and south and sinking, colder air at the poles. Like the Hadley Cells, air masses tend to move southward on the surface and northward at height in the northern hemisphere’s Polar Cell, and vice a versa in the southern hemisphere. Between the Hadley Cells and the Polar Cells lies a more complicated zone of mixing, with varied air masses tending in general to move along the surface from the 30<sup class="txt-sup default">th</sup> to the 60<sup class="txt-sup default">th</sup> degrees of latitude.

<p class="para">The Coriolis Effect diverts winds to the east and west</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">The spinning of the Earth has an influence on the motion of air masses at the planet’s surface. As demonstrated in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0003">Figure 4.3</a>, the closer to the Equator an object (including an air mass) is on the surface of the Earth, the faster it is moving compared to an object further north or south, simply because the circumference of the Earth is larger at the Equator. For example, an air mass at Ithaca, New York (42.6° north), is spinning at only 75% of the rate of an object on the Equator, so as it moves south toward the Equator, the underlying surface is moving faster to the east than is the air mass, which has its eastern velocity set by its starting point in Ithaca. As a result, the air mass moves somewhat to the west, relative to the Earth’s surface, as well as moving south. This tendency is termed the Coriolis Effect. It interacts with the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells to control the average direction of surface winds on the planet: from east to west between the Equator and 30° north and south, from west to east between 30° and 60° north and south, and again from east to west between 60° and the poles (<span id="widget-62599" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62599" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 4.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62599"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para">Rising and falling air and precipitation patterns</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The rising and falling of these various air masses dramatically affects precipitation patterns on the Earth’s surface. The pressure of air decreases rapidly with increasing height as it rises in the atmosphere. From chemistry’s Universal Gas Laws, the temperature of a gas is proportional to its pressure, if volume is held constant. Therefore, temperature falls as pressure falls in the rising air masses of the Hadley and Polar Cells. Colder air cannot hold as much moisture, so as warm and moist air rises – particularly at the Equator because the starting air is so moist, but also near 60° north and south – the moisture condenses and falls back to the surface as precipitation. On the other hand, the descending air at 30° and the poles – which had already been stripped of much of its moisture as it rose – becomes even drier as its pressure and temperature increases. The end result is very high rates of rainfall near the Equator, quite dry regions in the areas north and south of 30° in both the southern and northern hemispheres, high precipitation again in the areas north and south of 60°, and very little precipitation at the poles (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0004">Figure 4.4</a>). Thus, for example, most of the major deserts of the world, including the Sahara, Kalahari, Mojave, and Sonoran, are found near 30° north or south. Of course, this is an idealized description, and the real patterns of climate on Earth have greater complexity, for a variety of reasons discussed below.</p>

<p class="para indent">One complication is the seasonality caused by the change in tilt of the Earth’s axis relative to the sun over the course of its annual rotation around the sun. During the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more towards the sun, and on the solstice in June, the direct right angle of sunlight hits the Earth further north than the Equator. The Northern Hemisphere gets more heating from sunlight than at the time of the equinoxes, while the Southern Hemisphere gets less. Of course, this whole pattern is reversed around the time of the December solstice. This seasonal oscillation in the distribution of heating shifts the Hadley Cells north and south from their position at the time of the equinoxes. And in turn, the regions of greatest and least rainfall shift as well.</p>
<p class="para indent">Another issue is the influence of mountain ranges. On the side of mountains hit by prevailing winds (that is the eastern side between the Equator and 30° and between 60° and the poles, and the western side between 30° and 60°), air masses rise to go over the mountains, and cool and drop their moisture as they do so. On the downwind side of the mountains, descending air will be very dry, creating a so-called <span class="txt-bold">rain shadow</span> (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0005">Figure 4.5</a>). Some of the most severe deserts on Earth such as Death Valley in California are created by this effect, while incredible rain and snowfall create rain forests on the upwind side of many mountain ranges, such as the Cascades in the northwestern United States.</p>

<p class="para">The world’s oceans represent a continuous fluid, and as with any fluid, denser water in the oceans will tend to sink and less dense water rise throughout the world. The waters in the northern parts of the North Atlantic Ocean are unusually dense, both because they are cooled in the northern latitudes and because they are relatively salty: the result of greater evaporation than input of freshwaters in precipitation and rivers. Consequently, these waters sink, and other waters from further south move forward on the surface to replace them (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0007">Figure 4.7</a>). The waters moving north in the Atlantic originate in the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and flow through the South Atlantic Ocean on their way to the North Atlantic. This flow, bringing warm waters into the North Atlantic Ocean, is a main driver behind the Gulf Stream and helps to maintain a temperate climate far into the north of Europe. The deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean flow southward at depth, through the South Atlantic Ocean and into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. There, they rise to the surface to replace the waters flowing on the surface toward the North Atlantic Ocean. This great conveyor belt of ocean circulation is critical to redistributing heat across the Earth. It is also very important in helping to mitigate human-driven global change: the cold North Atlantic waters absorb very large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere before they sink, and once these waters have sunk, that carbon dioxide stays trapped in the deep ocean water masses for centuries before eventually coming back to the surface and being released (see <span id="widget-62600" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62600" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62600"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Climate scientists fear that the great conveyor belt may slow in response to global warming, and indeed there is some evidence that this may already have started: in fact, a paper in <span class="txt-italic">Nature</span> published in 2005 by scientists from the UK National Oceanography Centre in Southampton (Bryden et al., 2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0073">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0073</a>-->) reported a 30% slowing between 1957 and 2004, based on comparing ocean current measurements over time. The concern is that melting of Arctic sea ice and of glaciers in Greenland combined with greater river flows from Siberia into the Arctic Ocean will, as some of the Arctic Ocean waters reach the North Atlantic, make the North Atlantic Ocean less salty, and therefore less dense. The intensity of the great conveyor belt is driven by the density differences between the North Atlantic and the surface waters of the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, so this freshening would slow the flow globally. The consequences on the distribution of climate globally would be dramatic, and the mitigation of global warming by oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide would be greatly diminished.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">One criticism that has been leveled at the 2005 paper published in Nature is that the measured slowing of the conveyor belt across the decades is barely statistically significant (see <span id="widget-62601" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62601" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 1.3</span></span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62601"></div>). This should not be surprising, given the difficulty of measuring currents at the scale of the ocean. How would you respond to a relative or friend who says ‘I am not going to worry about climate change and some abstract idea of change in the oceans until the science becomes stronger and more convincing’?<p></p>

Biomes are not homogeneous within their hypothetical boundaries; every biome has gradients of physicochemical conditions related to local topography and geology. Within the global mosaic are further mosaics at smaller and smaller scales. The communities of plants and animals that occur in different parts of this heterogeneous patchwork may be quite distinct.</p>

Moving into colder regions at higher latitudes, boreal forests dominate when the precipitation is sufficiently high, with deserts in regions of extremely low precipitation. Tundra dominates in the coldest of the planet’s regions.

Similarly, 230 species in the genus <span class="txt-italic">Eucalyptus</span> (gum tree) occur naturally in Australia (and two or three in Indonesia and Malaysia).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Tropical rain forest</h2>
<p class="para">We have chosen to discuss tropical rain forests in greater depth than the other biomes because it represents the global peak of evolved biological diversity on land; all the other terrestrial biomes suffer from a relative poverty of resources or more strongly constraining conditions. Tropical rain forests cover approximately 12% of the Earth’s land area and contain more than half the entire biomass of all terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p class="para indent">Tropical rain forest is also the most productive of the Earth’s biomes, with a rate of <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c04-tdef-0002" title="the rate at which biomass is produced per unit area by plants" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - primary production">primary production</span>—that is, the total amount of photosynthesis per area for a defined length of time—that can exceed 800 g of carbon fixed per square meter per year (see <span id="widget-62607" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62607" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62607"></div>). Such exceptional productivity results from the coincidence of high solar radiation received throughout the year and regular, abundant, and reliable rainfall. The production is achieved, overwhelmingly, high in the dense forest canopy of evergreen foliage. It is dark at ground level except where fallen trees create gaps. A characteristic of this biome is that often many tree seedlings and saplings remain in a suppressed state from year to year, and only leap into action if a gap forms in the canopy above them.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Indeed, almost all the action in a rain forest (not just photosynthesis but also flowering, fruiting, predation, and herbivory) happens high in the canopy. Apart from the trees, the vegetation is largely composed of plant forms that reach up into the canopy vicariously, by climbing the trees (vines and lianas, including many species of fig) or growing as <span class="txt-bold">epiphytes</span>, which are plants that grow on other plants, rooted on the damp upper branches. The epiphytes depend on the sparse resources of mineral nutrients they extract from crevices and pockets of humus on the tree branches. The rich floras and faunas of the canopy are not easy to study; even to gain access to the flowers in order to identify the species of tree is difficult without the erection of tree walks. It is a measure of the problems of doing research in a rain forest that botanists have trained monkeys to collect and throw down flowers, and a research team has used hot air balloons to move over the canopy and work in it.</p>
<p class="para indent">Most species of animals and plants in tropical rain forest are active throughout the year, though the plants may flower and ripen fruit in sequence. In Trinidad, for example, the forest contains at least 18 trees in the genus <span class="txt-italic">Miconia</span>, whose combined fruiting seasons extend throughout the year (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0011">Figure 4.11</a>). This contrasts with the situation in temperate latitudes where there is a much narrower fruiting season that most species share.</p>

This situation raises some fundamental questions that have proved very difficult to resolve. First, what is it about the evolutionary history of tropical rain forest that has allowed such diversity to evolve? Part of the answer relates to the comparative stability of patches of rain forest during the ice ages. As we saw in <span id="widget-62609" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62609" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 2.5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62609"></div></span>, it is thought that during these periods, drought forced tropical rain forests to contract into ‘islands’ (in a ‘sea’ of savanna), and these expanded and coalesced again as wetter periods returned. This would have promoted genetic isolation of populations, a phenomenon that is so important for speciation to occur (see <span id="widget-62610" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62610" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 2.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62610"></div></span>). We may also ask why it is that among the diversity of species in tropical rain forests, a few have not dominated and suppressed the rest in a struggle for existence. We will see later (<span id="widget-62611" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62611" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 10</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62611"></div></span>) that at least part of the answer is that populations of specialized pathogens and herbivores develop near mature trees and attack new recruits of the same tree species nearby. Thus, the chance that a new seedling will survive can be expected to increase with its distance from a mature tree of the same species, reducing the likelihood of dominance by one or a few species in the forest.<p></p>

<p class="para">… and intense soil activity</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">There is intense biological activity in the soil of tropical rain forests. Leaf litter decomposes faster than in any other biome, and as a result the soil surface is often almost bare. The mineral nutrients in fallen leaves are rapidly released, and, as rainfall seeps down the soil profile, nutrients may be carried well below the levels at which roots can recover them. Almost all the mineral nutrients in a rain forest are held in the plants themselves, where they are safe from leaching. When such forests are cleared for agriculture, or the timber is felled or destroyed by fire, the nutrients are released and leached or washed away: on slopes the whole soil may go too. The full regeneration of soil and of a nutrient budget in a new forest may take centuries. Evidence of cultivated patches within rain forest can still be seen clearly from the air 40 years or more after they have been deserted.</p>
<p class="para indent">All the other terrestrial biomes can be seen as the poor relations of tropical rain forest. They are all colder or drier and all are more seasonal. They have had prehistories that prevented the evolution of a diversity of animals and plants that approaches the remarkable species richness of tropical rain forest. Moreover, they are generally less suited to the lives of extreme specialists, both plant and animal.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Savanna</h2>
<p class="para">As in tropical rain forests, temperatures in the savanna biome are consistently warm. Rain, though, falls reliably only during part of the year, and the rest of the year can be quite dry. This seasonality is driven by the annual movement of the Hadley Cells. Approximately 9% of the land area of the planet is composed of savanna biome.</p>
<p class="para indent">The vegetation of savanna characteristically consists of grassland with scattered small trees, but extensive areas have no trees. The trees actively grow only during the rainy season. In the absence of other controlling factors, these tropical areas would be expected to be covered by forest. But forest development is kept in check, in part by the limited moisture that limits their growth to the rainy season, but also by grazing and fire. In some savannas, herds of grazing herbivores (like zebra <span class="txt-italic">Equus burchelli</span> and wildebeest <span class="txt-italic">Connochaetes taurinus</span> in Africa; <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0014">Figure 4.14</a>) have a profound influence on the vegetation, favoring grasses (which protect their embryonic, actively dividing tissues in buds at or just below ground level) and hindering the regeneration of trees (because these same tissues are exposed to browsing animals). In other cases, fire is the critical thing. Fire, whether natural or human-induced, can be a common hazard in the dry season and, like grazing animals, tips the balance in the vegetation against trees and shrubs and favors perennial grasses, with their underground rhizomes and protected regenerating surfaces (<span id="widget-62613" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62613" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 4.15</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62613"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Seasonal rainfall places the most severe restrictions on the diversity of plants and animals in savanna. Plant growth is limited for part of the year by drought, and there is a seasonal glut of food, alternating with shortage.

<p class="para indent">Desert vegetation falls into two sharply contrasted patterns of behavior. Many species have an opportunistic lifestyle, stimulated into germination by the unpredictable rains (physiological ‘internal’ clocks are useless in this environment). They grow fast and complete their life history by starting to set new seed after a few weeks. These are the species that can occasionally make a desert bloom; the ecophysiologist Fritz Went called them “belly plants” because only someone lying on the ground can appreciate their individual charm.</p>
<p class="para indent">A different pattern of behavior of arid desert plants is to be long-lived with sluggish physiological processes. Cacti and other succulents, and small shrubby species with small, thick, and often hairy leaves, can close their stomata and tolerate long periods of physiological inactivity and have the CAM specialized photosynthetic systems to maximally conserve water (see <span id="widget-62615" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62615" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62615"></div>).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Temperate forest</h2>
<p class="para">Like all biomes, temperate forest includes, under one name, a variety of types of vegetation. At its low-latitude limits in Florida and New Zealand, winters are mild, frosts and droughts are rare, and the vegetation largely consists of broad-leaved evergreen trees. At its northern limits in the forests of Maine and the upper Midwest of the United States, the seasons are strongly marked, winter days are short, and there may be 6 months of freezing temperatures. Deciduous trees, which dominate in many, temperate forests, lose their leaves in the fall and become dormant after transferring much of their mineral content to the woody body of the tree. On the forest floor, diverse floras of perennial herbs often occur, particularly those that grow quickly in the spring, before the new tree foliage has developed. Temperate forests make up 8% of the terrestrial biosphere, with a slightly larger area covered by temperate deciduous forests than by temperate evergreen forests.</p>
<p class="para indent">All forests are patchy because old trees die, providing open environments for new colonists. This patchiness is on an especially large scale after hurricanes fell the older and taller trees or after fire kills the more sensitive species. In temperate forests the canopies are often composed of a mixture of long-lived species, such as red oaks (<span class="txt-italic">Quercus rubra</span>) in the Midwest of the United States, and colonizers of gaps, such as sugar maple (<span class="txt-italic">Acer saccharum</span>).</p>
<p class="para indent">Temperate forests provide food resources for animals that are usually very seasonal in their occurrence (compare <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0011">Figure 4.11b</a> with <span id="widget-62616" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62616" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">4.11a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62616"></div>), and only species with short life cycles, such as leaf-eating insects, can be dietary specialists.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Boreal forest (taiga)</h2>
<p class="para">Boreal forests (also known as taiga, particularly in Russia) are coniferous and occur in regions where the short growing season and the polar cold of winter limit the vegetation and its associated fauna. The summers tend to be warmer, though, with some influence from temperate air masses as the Ferrel cells and Polar cells move further north. Boreal forests make up approximately 8% of the land surface of the planet.</p>
<p class="para indent">The tree flora is quite limited. Where winters are less severe, the forests may be dominated by evergreen pines (<span class="txt-italic">Pinus</span> species) and firs (<span class="txt-italic">Abies</span>) as well as deciduous trees such as larch (<span class="txt-italic">Larix</span>), birch (<span class="txt-italic">Betula</span>), or aspens (<span class="txt-italic">Populus</span>), often as mixtures of species. Farther north, these species give way to monotonous single-species forests of spruce (<span class="txt-italic">Picea</span>) over immense areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. This provides an extreme contrast to the biodiversity of tropical rain forests.</p>
<p class="para indent">Much of the areas now occupied by boreal forests (as well as much of the northern temperate forests) were occupied by the ice sheet during the last ice age, which started to withdraw only 20,000 years ago. Temperatures are now as high as they have ever been since that time, but the vegetation has not yet caught up with the changing climate and the forests are still spreading north. The very low diversity of northern floras and faunas is in part a reflection of a slow recovery from the catastrophes of the ice ages.</p>
<p class="para indent">Permafrost is a major environmental constraint in boreal spruce forests. The water in the soil remains frozen throughout the year, creating permanent drought except when the sun warms the very surface. The root system of spruce can develop in only the superficial soil layer, from which the trees derive all their water during the short growing season.</p>

For example, the spruce budworm (<span class="txt-italic">Choristoneura fumiferana</span>) lives at low densities in immature northern forests of spruce.

During major fires, even some of the organic matter in the soil burns, which can contribute significantly to the global flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. In many boreal forests, major fires occur every 75 to 100 years. Most of the mature trees die resetting the stage for ecological succession.

<p class="para">To the north of the boreal forest, polar air masses and cold temperatures dominate even in the summer. Here, the vegetation changes to tundra, with its low shrubs, grasses, sedges, and small flowering plants, as well as mosses and lichens. Permafrost is a dominant feature, as in the boreal forest, but even less melting of surface soil occurs in the summer. In the very coldest areas, rooted plants such as grasses and sedges disappear because of the permafrost, leaving only mosses and lichens that grow on rather than in the soil. The tundra makes up some 5% of the terrestrial land surface of Earth.</p>
<p class="para indent">The number of species of higher plants (excluding mosses and lichens) decreases from 600 species in the Low Arctic of North America to 100 species in the High Arctic (north of 83°) of Greenland and Ellesmere Island.

Lemmings (<span class="txt-italic">Lemmus</span>) are famous for their population cycles and the role they play in the tundra. When the snow melts during a period when the lemming cycle is at a high point, the animals are exposed and they support large migratory populations of predatory birds (owls, skuas, gulls) and mammals such as weasels. Reindeer and caribou (they are the same species, <span class="txt-italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) occur in migrant herds capable of foraging on lichens of the tundra, which they can reach through the snow cover.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Permafrost and generally cold temperatures severely limit decomposition in tundra ecosystems, so soils tend to be very organic rich. Until recently, fires were very rare in the tundra. However, over the past decade, global warming has led to many more and much larger fires in the Arctic tundra (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0019">Figure 4.19</a>), for two reasons. First, somewhat warmer temperatures have led to higher rates of evapotranspiration, and therefore drier soils that can more easily burn. And second, convective thunderstorms—once almost unheard of in the Arctic—are becoming more common. The resulting lightning provides the spark to set off a fire. These tundra fires, as with fires in boreal forests, may become an increasingly important source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That is, global warming is providing a feedback in the tundra biome, where increasing fires further increase concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>

It is enough to note that the simulations shown in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0020">Figures 4.20</a> and <span id="widget-62620" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62620" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">4.21</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62620"></div> are based on a climate change model that assumes an effective doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations and takes into account the coupling of atmosphere and ocean in determining changes in patterns of temperature and rainfall.

<h1 class="level-1 enum-head txt-orange"><span class="enum">4.3</span> Aquatic Ecosystems on The Continents</h1>
<p class="para">The aquatic ecosystems on the continents—lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands—cover less than 1% of the land mass of the Earth and represent only 0.007% of the water on the planet. Most of the water on Earth is in the oceans, and most freshwater is frozen in glaciers and ice sheets. Nonetheless, these aquatic ecosystems are immensely important in the ecological functioning of the landscape around them, are critical resources of human society, and of course are ecologically interesting in their own right.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c04-sec-0019">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Streams and rivers</h2>
<p class="para">Streams and rivers throughout much of the world have been tapped, dammed, straightened, rerouted, dredged, and polluted since the beginning of civilization. Understanding the impacts and sustainability of some of these practices begins with understanding the basics of stream and river ecology.</p>
<p class="para indent">Streams and rivers are characterized by their linear form, unidirectional flow, fluctuating discharge, and unstable beds. Streams and rivers form a continuum, with several small streams joining together in their downstream flow to form a river, and smaller rivers joining together to form larger and larger rivers. The water entering a stream comes from its <span class="txt-bold">watershed</span>—the land area where all the water draining from it comes to the particular stream or river—through groundwater flows, surface runoff, or both. The ecological functioning of streams and rivers is intimately connected to their watersheds. With the water from the watershed comes nutrients, other dissolved substances, and eroded silt and soil. Not only do these inputs influence the streams and rivers, but the streams and rivers carry the dissolved and eroded particles to lakes and to coastal oceans. Virtually all the areas of terrestrial biomes form watersheds and are drained by some stream or river. In the words of the late German geochemist Egen Degens, “rivers are the arteries of the continents.”</p>
<p class="para indent">The vegetation of the watershed has a pronounced influence on a stream. Streams in forested regions are shaded by trees, so with little of the light they need, production of algae in the stream is low (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0022">Figure 4.22</a>). The ecological community of the stream is fueled instead largely by inputs of organic matter from the forest, through falling leaves and dissolved organic matter. Specialized insects shred and eat the leaves, while bacteria grow on the dissolved organic matter, and the bacteria in turn are consumed by insects. The shading and inputs of relatively cold groundwater (in temperate areas) during the summer helps keep the stream cool. Since oxygen is much more soluble in cold water than in warm water, the cooler streams allow plentiful levels of dissolved oxygen that are necessary for several species of fish such as brown trout (<span class="txt-italic">Salmo trutta</span>). In grasslands, streams are often still shaded by <span class="txt-bold">riparian</span> trees, that is, species adapted to grow in the narrow strip along the stream where water is plentiful. However, desert streams are less shaded, and the food webs are more fueled by productive micro-algae growing attached to rocks and pebbles. Unshaded streams also tend to be warmer and therefore have less dissolved oxygen.</p>

<p class="para indent">When habitats with forest or riparian trees are converted to agriculture, there can be far-reaching effects (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0023">Figure 4.23</a>). Less shading leads to warmer temperatures and less dissolved oxygen. The supply of organic matter from leaves is cut off and from dissolved organic matter is lessened, and algal and plant growth in the stream increases, drastically changing the whole community. The water flow often increases, since evapotranspiration in the watershed is less for crops than for native vegetation. Erosion from the surrounding land increases, and the streambed will therefore often have a higher amount of fine mineral particles. Nutrient inputs also increase, which can have major deleterious effects on downstream lakes and coastal marine ecosystems (see <span id="widget-62623" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62623" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62623"></div>).<p></p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="para indent">For streams draining all types of watershed, as streams join up to form larger streams and rivers, these rivers obviously become wider, resulting in relatively little shading. When the climate is warm (year round in the tropics and in the summer in temperate regions), the waters tend to warm and hold less dissolved oxygen. Production by attached algae and rooted plants increases, and in larger regions, production by phytoplankton (free-floating microscopic algae) may become important. In streams and small rivers, by contrast, phytoplankton production is seldom large, as the floating microorganisms are moved downstream faster than they can grow.</p>
<p class="para indent">Streams and rivers not only drain the landscape, but at times of high discharge, water from the streams and rivers often flows onto the nearby land, termed the floodplain. As streams and rivers become larger, the size of the floodplain also increases in size. For instance, the Amazon (the world’s second longest river, but the world’s largest river in terms of watershed area and water flow) is “only” a few km wide during periods of low flow, but during the annual flooding period, the river expands onto the forested floodplain, to become a river 50 km in width (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0024">Figure 4.24</a>).</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Lakes and ponds</h2>
<p class="para">Just as streams and rivers are defined by the unidirectional flow of water, ponds and lakes are defined by the relatively stationary nature of water within them. The residence time of water in these ecosystems varies, but is often in the range of months to decades, in contrast to residence times of water in streams and rivers of minutes to at most weeks. The smaller of these relatively stationary aquatic ecosystems we call ponds, systems that are shallow and generally less than a hectare or so in surface area. Because ponds are shallow, light often reaches the bottom, and rooted plants are frequently highly productive.</p>
<p class="para indent">Lakes are larger, and usually deeper, although there is no clear cutoff in size between ponds and lakes. In shallow lakes, as in ponds, light can reach the bottom, allowing rooted plants and attached algae to thrive. In deeper lakes, very little light can reach the bottom, and phytoplankton are the dominant primary producers. These in turn are grazed by zooplankton, leading to a food web structure quite different from one based on rooted plants.</p>
<p class="para indent">Water is unusual in remaining liquid over a wide range of temperatures. It requires a lot of energy to heat it (it has high thermal capacity), but it retains heat efficiently. One consequence is that the temperature of large bodies of water (oceans and large lakes) varies little over the seasons. A further peculiar physical property of water is that it is less dense when frozen than when liquid. Like most liquids, water becomes denser and sinks as it cools. However, at temperatures below 4°C, water becomes less dense and when ice forms (at 0°C), it floats. Ice on a water surface insulates the water beneath; lakes and streams can remain liquid, free-flowing, and inhabitable under a layer of ice.</p>
<p class="para indent">A critical component of lake ecology is the way in which water can stratify vertically in response to temperature. As water sits in a lake, the upper layer is exposed to the sun and heats up. Because warm water is less dense than cold (and therefore tends to rise) the top layer stratifies – that is to say, it forms a layer that is quite separate from the colder water beneath. This surface layer is relatively warm and well illuminated during the summer, and has high oxygen content because surface waters exchange oxygen with the atmosphere. The surface of the lake can be quite productive, when nutrient inputs are sufficiently high, with high densities of algal and animal life.</p>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c04-feafxd-0015">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">lakes may become thermally stratified, with major consequences for their ecology</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In many lakes during the summer, below the surface layer lies a transitional zone, the <span class="txt-bold">thermocline</span>, in which temperature rapidly decreases. The thermocline acts as a barrier for exchange between the surface layer and the deeper, colder water. Often, little if any light penetrates as deeply as this lower layer, as the light is absorbed and scattered by the water and particles in the surface layer. Without light, no photosynthesis occurs in the lower layer. Dead organic matter from the surface layer will sink through the thermocline and decompose in the lower layer. Without photosynthesis to produce new oxygen, with no exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere, and with only limited exchange of more oxygenated surface water across the thermocline, the decomposition in the lower layer can lead to complete depletion of dissolved oxygen. When this happens, fish and other animals cannot live in the lower layer, and life there consists only of microbial processes not dependent upon oxygen. The decomposition also produces dissolved inorganic nutrients. Whatever limited exchange of water occurs across the thermocline in summer can be important in bringing these nutrients to the surface layer, where nutrient concentrations tend to be much lower due to uptake by phytoplankton to support primary production of new organic matter.</p>
<p class="para indent">In temperate regions of the Earth, stratification of lake water breaks down in the fall when the upper layer cools. The surface and bottom layers fully mix, putting oxygen into the bottom layer, until winter stratification sets in. In lakes in winter in the temperate zone, the surface waters are actually colder than waters of the lower layer, which hover around 4°C (at which temperature water has its greatest density). The surface layer is cooled below this, and often a layer of ice forms at the very surface. In the spring, as the lake warms, it again mixes from top to bottom until summer stratification sets back in.</p>
<p class="para indent">In the tropics, many lakes are permanently stratified, with a constantly warm surface layer and a somewhat cooler lower layer below the thermocline. There is never sufficient cooling of the surface layer to break down this stratification seasonally in much of the tropics. Very commonly, the lower layer in these tropical lakes is devoid of dissolved oxygen.</p>

These lakes can become quite rich in dissolved salts. Such saline lakes should not be considered as oddities; globally, they are just as abundant as freshwater lakes. They are usually very fertile and often have dense populations of photosynthetic cyanobacteria.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Wetlands</h2>
<p class="para">Wetlands are an intermediate type of ecosystem between terrestrial and aquatic ones: they have soils that are waterlogged, either perpetually or very frequently, and water may even cover the vegetation of the wetland at times. Ecologists classify wetlands by the type of dominant vegetation. Where trees dominate, the wetland is called a swamp. Marshes and fens are dominated by grasses and/or sedges. And mosses of the genus <span class="txt-italic">Sphagnum</span> dominate bogs, which are usually very acidic (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0025">Figure 4.25</a>).

<p class="para indent">Because water never limits plant growth and nutrients are frequently very high, plant production in wetlands is among the highest in any natural ecosystem on Earth. This is particularly true for swamps and marshes. In bogs, the great acidity somewhat limits the rate of plant production.</p>
<p class="para indent">Only a limited amount of oxygen can dissolve in water, and oxygen diffuses through water at a rate 10,000-fold more slowly than through air. The oxygen in wetland soils is rapidly depleted by the high rates of microbial decomposition there, fed by abundant inputs of dead plant materials. This slow rate of oxygen diffusion through the waterlogged soils ensures that the soils remain oxygen free, but microbial processes continue in the absence of oxygen, and cause a variety of important biogeochemical changes. One of these, the bacterial conversion of dissolved nitrate to N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> gas, is a critical influence on the global distribution of this major nutrient.

<h1 class="level-1 enum-head txt-orange"><span class="enum">4.4</span> Ocean Biomes</h1>
<p class="para">The oceans cover 70% of the area of the planet and contain 97% of the planet’s water. On average the oceans are 4 km deep, and at the very deepest 11 km. On average, the rate of primary production per area in the oceans is about half that in terrestrial biomes, so the total amount of primary productivity on Earth is roughly the same in the oceans as on land. We will come back to the topic of primary production and discuss it in more detail in <span id="widget-62627" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62627" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62627"></div>. Just as production in some terrestrial ecosystems is much higher than in others (compare rain forest and arid deserts), so too is primary production in the oceans quite variable from place to place. Phytoplankton are the dominant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans. Their life span is considerably shorter than the plant life of terrestrial biomes: days for phytoplankton compared to months, years, decades, or even centuries for terrestrial plants. Consequently, while total photosynthesis and primary production are comparable in the oceans and on land, the amount of biomass at any given time is far, far greater on land.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">As in lakes, sunlight is absorbed and scattered by the water itself and by particles in the water (including phytoplankton). In the very clear, blue water of some open-ocean regions, light penetrates as deeply as 200 m into the water column (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0027">Figure 4.27</a>). Elsewhere in the oceans, such as the more productive and phytoplankton-rich coastal waters, light may only penetrate 50 m or less. This surface layer where light penetrates is called the <span class="txt-bold">photic zone</span>. At depths below the photic zone – which includes a lot of water when we consider the average ocean depth of 4 km – no photosynthesis can occur.</p>

<p class="para indent">Many ecologists use the word “biome” only to describe terrestrial systems, but the oceans too have large distinctive regions with characteristic ecological functions. Here, we also use the term “biome” for these ocean regions. While terrestrial biomes are the result of the interaction of temperature and precipitation (Figure 4.09b), ocean biomes are defined by the interaction of light (the depth of the photic zone) and nutrients (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0028">Figure 4.28</a>). The availability of both light and nutrients, in turn, are determined to a large extent by the physical mixing characteristics of a region and by proximity to land. In this brief section, we do not describe all the areas of the ocean but rather focus on the range of type of biomes and the most important ones in terms of global productivity, area, or resources for society.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">The deep ocean</h2>
<p class="para">By far most of the water in the oceans—96% of the total volume—is in the deep ocean below the photic zone. Here, the food webs are fueled largely by a rain of dead organic matter falling out of the photic zone. As this organic matter is consumed by heterotrophs, inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide are released. The deep ocean waters are therefore very enriched in both nutrients and carbon dioxide. This is particularly true for the deep North Pacific Ocean. Lying at the end of the great conveyor belt (see <span id="widget-62629" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62629" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 4.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62629"></div>), its waters have been at depth for longer before the water again rises to the surface than in the rest of the oceans (hundreds of years), and have therefore had more time to accumulate these nutrients from ongoing consumption of the organic matter.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Most of the world’s oceans are strongly stratified, and most of the deep ocean is below the thermocline and has a temperature of 4°C, roughly that of a kitchen refrigerator. The cold results in very slow rates of bacterial decomposition, a fact dramatically demonstrated when the deep-water submersible <span class="txt-italic">Alvin</span> sank in 1.5 km of water in 1968 (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0029">Figure 4.29</a>). The vessel sat on the bottom for 10 months before being retrieved. Once back on the surface, the sandwich lunches that had been on the <span class="txt-italic">Alvin</span> were found to have suffered no discernible degradation, and a cheese sandwich—although soggy with seawater—was still edible enough to actually be eaten. Despite the slow rate of microbial decomposition, little organic matter persists in the deep ocean, and the organic content of sediments is remarkably low, in part because the inputs of organic matter to the deep ocean from the surface photic zone are relatively small.</p>

Only discovered in the past 50 years, these vents pump out extremely hot water laden with reduced chemical substances, such as hydrogen sulfide. Special chemoautotrophic bacteria use the chemical energy of these substances, oxidizing it to gain energy for producing new organic matter from carbon dioxide (see <span id="widget-62631" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62631" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62631"></div></span>). At the deep-sea hot vents, many of these chemo-autotrophic bacteria are <span class="txt-bold">symbionts</span> of animals, meaning they live inside them, providing them with nutrients, such as tubeworms that can grow to more than 2 meters tall. Large animal populations are commonly supported off this chemical energy at the hot vents. But these vents are a rarity in the deep oceans, and an exception to the general rule that life in the deep sea is driven by the slow use of a slow rain of dead organic matter material from the photic zone into very cold water.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Subtropical gyres</h2>
<p class="para">The planet has five subtropical ocean <span class="txt-bold">gyres</span> in the north and south Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Indian Ocean. These are large masses of semi-isolated surface water surrounded by a circular current of water moving clockwise for the two gyres in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise for the three gyres in the southern hemisphere (<span id="widget-62632" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62632" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 4.6</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62632"></div>). Combined, they cover approximately half the surface area of the world’s oceans, or 35% of the entire surface of the planet: more than the entire land area on all continents. The gyre in the North Atlantic Ocean is called the Sargasso Sea, named after the large mats of floating <span class="txt-italic">Sargassum</span> algae commonly found there. It is the only gyre named a “sea,” and the only named sea whose boundaries are defined by ocean currents rather than land masses. But the term “sea” is a fitting description for these gyres, since their water has only very modest exchanges across the boundary currents with neighboring ocean masses. Only the occasional eddy carries parcels of the gyre water out and parcels of neighboring water masses into the gyres.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Rates of primary productivity in the gyres are the lowest for any aquatic ecosystems on Earth, and rival the rates found in any but the most arid deserts on land (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0030">Figure 4.30</a> and <span id="widget-62633" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62633" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62633"></div>). The water is clear and blue, in part because primary production and phytoplankton biomass are low, and in part because of the isolation from the input of particles from erosion on land carried to the oceans in rivers. The clarity of the water allows light to penetrate as deeply as anywhere in the world’s oceans, up to 200 meters (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0027">Figure 4.27</a>). However, nutrients are in very short supply. In fact, in the surface waters, the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus are as low as in distilled water. Abundant nutrients are near, in the waters of the deep ocean just a few hundred meters below these surface-water gyres. But those nutrients are largely trapped in the deep ocean, with very little exchange by limited mixing of waters across the strong thermocline. The very low nutrient supply severely limits the rate of primary productivity.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Most of the phytoplankton species in these subtropical gyres are very small, an adaptation to the low nutrient availability: small cells have a high surface to volume ratio, which provides a lot of area for nutrient uptake relative to the volume of chlorophyll and other photosynthetic apparatus within the cell (see <span id="widget-62635" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62635" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 3.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62635"></div>). These very small phytoplankton are consumed by very small zooplankton, which in turn are then consumed by somewhat larger animals, leading to long food chains. Since some energy is lost at each step in the food chain (see <span id="widget-62636" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62636" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62636"></div></span>), the flow of energy to top predators has a rather low efficiency compared to most other aquatic or terrestrial biomes. Compared to other parts of the oceans, the production of fish is low even relative to the low rate of net primary productivity.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Biodiversity, however, is very high in these subtropical gyres, perhaps the highest seen in any plankton-dominated ecosystems on Earth. Ecologists remain intrigued by what has led to this high diversity. Candidate explanations include the relative lack of disturbance over geological time scales, the low disturbance on shorter times, and perhaps the specialization that results from the low-nutrient status.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Coastal upwelling systems</h2>
<p class="para">Upwelling systems provide a sharp contrast to the nutrient-limited but light-abundant subtropical gyres. In upwelling systems, nutrient-rich deep ocean waters move steadily upward into the photic zone. Primary productivity and phytoplankton biomass are very high, which limits the penetration of light into the water column. The rising water keeps the phytoplankton buoyed near the surface, though, so they continue to have plenty of light.</p>
<p class="para indent">Coastal upwelling is caused by strong prevailing winds that blow parallel to coastlines, but due to the Coriolis effect, the water moves at a 90° angle to the prevailing wind. When this is away from land, as it is off the coast of Oregon and California in the United States and Baja California in Mexico, the offshore-flowing waters are replaced with new water rising (upwelling) from the depths (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0031">Figure 4.31</a>). Other major coastal upwelling areas occur off the western coast of Chile and Peru in the South Pacific Ocean, the western coast of South Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean, and the western coast of Mauritania and Morocco in the North Atlantic Ocean (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0030">Figure 4.30</a>). A very strong upwelling sets up seasonally to the east of Somalia in the Indian Ocean, driven by the southwestern monsoon winds. Cumulatively, these five upwelling areas produce 25% of the world’s fishery catch, yet they cover only 5% of the surface area of the oceans.</p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="para indent">The Southern Ocean—a large water mass that surrounds Antarctica—is another site of large-scale coastal upwelling. Strong prevailing winds blow from the west around the coast of Antarctica. Interacting with the Coriolis effect, surface waters move northward away from the continent, again being replaced by deep ocean water.</p>
<p class="para indent">In contrast to the gyres, the phytoplankton in upwelled waters tend to be relatively large, with a low ratio of surface area to volume, and are grazed by relatively large species of zooplankton, which in turn can be grazed by plankton-eating fish and whales, leading to relatively short food chains that efficiently transfer energy. This efficiency, combined with the high rates of primary productivity, is what leads to the extraordinarily productive fisheries of upwelling areas. While productivity is high, however, biodiversity is low. This association of low diversity with nutrient-rich, productive ecosystems is something else taken up in <span id="widget-62638" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62638" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 10</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62638"></div>.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Broad continental shelves</h2>
<p class="para">The major coastal upwelling systems all occur along coasts that have a narrow continental shelf. Deep ocean waters occur, for example, within 1 km along parts of the California coast. Along other coastlines, however, the continental shelf extends much further. Globally, the continental shelves stretch out on average 80 km from shore. The water depth on the average shelf is less than 150 m. Often, high nutrient inputs lead to high, and sometimes very high, rates of primary productivity. The water column is often stratified, with a relatively shallow photic zone that favors high production even though phytoplankton biomass (and resulting light absorption) can be high.</p>
<p class="para indent">The nutrients come from several sources, as we discuss in detail in <span id="widget-62639" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62639" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62639"></div>. One of these is rivers. A notable example is in the input of nutrients from the Mississippi River to the shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi carries huge quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus from the agricultural breadbasket of the American Midwest, and since the 1970s, this elevated nutrient load has over-stimulated primary production on the shelf. As the phytoplankton die in the bottom waters during summer when the water is stratified, oxygen is depleted, leading to a “dead zone” of 20,000 km<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup> or more, an area where fish and other animals cannot survive.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The deep ocean also provides nutrients to the continental shelves, notably in areas such as the North Sea and Georges Bank and the Grand Banks off the northeastern coast of North America, some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Georges Bank, an area of some 30,000 km<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup>, is, even at its closest, 100 km off the coast of Massachusetts, yet in places it is only a few meters deep. This shallowness contributes to high rates of primary production, since phytoplankton are always near the surface where the light is most intense. The incredible fisheries of Georges Bank and the Grand Banks lured European fishers 1,000 years ago, and were a major attraction to the earlier European settlers of New England and Nova Scotia in the 16th and 17th centuries. But the once-abundant halibut of Georges Bank had already been overfished and depleted by 1850 (Bigelow &amp; Shroeder, 1953), and overfishing of other fish species has continued since (see <span id="widget-62640" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62640" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62640"></div>).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Nearshore coastal marine ecosystems</h2>
<p class="para">The final types of ocean ecosystems we consider in this chapter are the diverse types that lie right on the coastal fringe, including the intertidal zone, the near-shore submerged littoral zone, and estuaries. These ecosystems serve as nursery grounds for many species of fish and invertebrates and provide critical habitat for other species, including sea turtles, shore birds, and many species of marine mammals. They are often beautiful, and provide enjoyment to millions of people who live near the coast or travel to the coast on holidays. And since they are accessible, they are also the parts of the ocean most studied by ecologists. Here, we briefly describe some of these coastal marine ecosystems, but the list is in no way exhaustive.</p>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c04-feafxd-0017">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">The intertidal is underwater for only part of each day …</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The intertidal zone is the part of the shoreline that is submerged at high tide but exposed to air at low tide. The extent of this zone depends on the height of tides and the slope of the shore. Away from the shore, the tidal rise and fall are rarely greater than 1 m, but closer to shore the shape of the land mass can funnel the ebb and flow of the water to produce extraordinary tidal ranges of, for example, nearly 20 m in the Bay of Fundy (between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada). In contrast, the shores of the Mediterranean Sea experience scarcely any tidal range. Both algae and animals are profoundly affected by the physical force of wave action, and by the extremes of hot and cold that can occur during low tide (changes in air temperature and far less moderated than those of water). Low tide also presents a continued challenge of desiccation.</p>
<p class="para indent">On rocky shores, anemones, barnacles, and mussels attach themselves securely and permanently to the substrate and filter planktonic plants and animals from the water when the tides cover them. Other animals, such as limpets and snails, move to graze micro-algae from the rocks, and crabs move with the tides and use rock crevices as refuges. In addition to micro-algae, the flora in a rocky intertidal zone may include larger algae, such as kelps that fix themselves to the rock with specialized ‘holdfasts.’</p>
<p class="para indent">Environments are quite different on shallow sloping shores on which the tides deposit and stir up sand and mud. Here the dominant animals are mollusks and polychaete worms, living buried in the substrate and feeding by filtering the water when they are covered by the tides. Where sandy or muddy intertidal areas are adequately protected from waves, wetlands often develop. In the temperate zone, these are commonly salt marshes, such as the extensive ones dominated by the flowering grass <span class="txt-italic">Spartina</span> along the east coast of the United States. In the tropics, swamps dominated by mangrove trees are common.</p>

<p class="para indent">Below the low-tide mark begins the submerged littoral zone. A variety of types of communities occur in this zone, depending upon the characteristics of the bottom (rocky vs. sandy or muddy, etc.). Generally light penetrates to the bottom, so primary producer organisms that are attached to the bottom are very important, providing structured habitat in addition to often very high rates of primary production. The giant kelp (<span class="txt-italic">Macrocystis pyrifera</span>) is the largest algal species in the world and grows to lengths of over 50 m along several coastlines including the west coasts of North and South America, South Africa, New Zealand, and southern Australia, where it can adequately attach its holdfast to rocks and where the water temperatures are below 20°C (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0033">Figure 4.33</a>).

<p class="para indent">In other regions of the world, smaller but still highly productive beds of other types of macro-algae—including other species of kelp, but also red and green algae—thrive on rocky bottoms. On sandy bottoms, rooted grass species such as eelgrass (<span class="txt-italic">Zostera marina</span>) in the temperate zone and turtle grass (<span class="txt-italic">Thalassia testudinum</span>) in the tropics can form vast meadows (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c04-fig-0034">Figure 4.34</a>). The diversity of these seagrass meadows, particularly in the tropics, can be high. Coral reefs are also a common feature of the submerged littoral zone along many tropical coastlines, where water quality is sufficiently high to support their growth. Coral reefs boast some of the highest biodiversity for any type of ecosystem on Earth. Global change, however, poses huge risk to corals, both because warmer temperatures can lead to coral “bleaching”—the loss of algal symbionts from the coral—and because ocean acidification from the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere makes it more difficult for the coral animals to secrete their carbonate reefs.</p>

<p class="para">Estuaries are where rivers meet the sea …</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Estuaries are salty, semi-enclosed water bodies that exchange water with more open coastal waters. Often estuaries occur near the mouth of a river, where outflowing freshwater mixes with seawater. Other estuaries have rather small inputs of freshwater, as for example the waters behind barrier islands that exchange water tidally with coastal waters. Estuaries provide an intriguing mix of the conditions normally experienced in rivers, shallow lakes, and ponds, and the nearshore littoral zone.</p>
<p class="para indent">In one common type of estuary, the salt-wedge estuary, dense salt water enters from the ocean and travels along the bottom, up the estuary, while freshwater (which is less dense than seawater) entering from a river flows downstream over the salt water. Some mixing of the fresh and salt water occurs over the distance of the salt wedge, and so the surface waters gradually become saltier down the estuary and the bottom waters gradually fresher up the estuary. The shape of the salt water wedge is largely determined by the size of the discharge of the river flowing into the estuary; high discharge tends to create a smaller wedge of salt water and less mixing. The strong gradients in salinity, in both space and time, are reflected in a specialized estuarine fauna. Some animals cope through particular physiological mechanisms. Others avoid the variable salt concentrations by burrowing, closing protective shells, or moving away when conditions do not favor them.</p>
<p class="para indent">The salinity gradient over depth at any place in the salt-wedge estuary provides very strong stratification—year round—in addition to any temperature stratification that may develop in summer. This often makes estuaries prone to low-oxygen conditions in the bottom waters, and even anoxia (the complete absence of oxygen). Further, the dynamics of the salt wedge act to trap particles in the estuary. This can aggravate pollution from toxic substances, such as PCBs, which are adsorbed to particles. Estuaries also frequently receive very large inputs of nutrients in rivers and from the sewage of major cities – such as Venice, New York, Washington, San Francisco, and Hong Kong – that often lie on the estuary: the estuary is the harbor of the city. In the United States, two-thirds of estuaries are moderately to severely degraded from nutrient pollution. As with all biomes, human impacts add an additional dimension to the variations that make each environment unique, notwithstanding our broad-brush categorization.</p>

<p class="para">The intense heating near the Equator is redistributed across the planet through the movement of air in the atmosphere and ocean currents. In the atmosphere, heat is moved from the Equator toward the poles by sets of interacting cells: the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells. As air rises in these cells, it cools, leading to condensation of water vapor and high rates of precipitation. Where the air in cells falls back to the surface, it warms and becomes very dry. The resulting patterns of temperature and precipitation—interacting with ocean currents and mountain ranges—create the Earth’s mosaic of climate.</p>

<p class="para">Water makes up a very small area of the continents, but these aquatic ecosystems play a critical role in human society and in the ecological functioning of the landscape around them. Streams and rivers form a continuum that drains their watersheds and their ecological functioning is intimately connected to the watersheds. In ponds and small lakes, sunlight often reaches the bottom, and rooted plants can be important primary producers. In deeper lakes, no sunlight can reach the bottom sediments, and phytoplankton are the dominant primary producers. Wetlands ecosystems are intermediate between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Some types, particularly marshes and swamps, are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth.</p>

<p class="para">Ocean currents and stratification result in a series of types of water masses, generating ocean biomes structured along gradients in the availability of nutrients and of light. The deep ocean is dark and cold and life is dependent on a rain of dead organic matter from the ocean’s surface waters. In the subtropical gyres, light is plentiful, and the low nutrient availability leads to very low rates of primary production, but biological diversity is very high. In coastal upwelling systems, cold nutrient-rich water from the deep oceans rises to the surface providing nutrients, where extremely high rates of primary production result, often leading to very productive fisheries. In the broad continental shelves, light in the shallow surface layer is high, and nutrient supply is also often high.</p>

<p class="para">what is a population?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">As ecologists, we try to describe and understand the distribution and abundance of organisms. We may do so because we wish to control a pest or conserve an endangered species, or simply because we are fascinated by the world around us. A major part of our task, therefore, involves studying changes in the size of populations. We use the term <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c05-tdef-0001" title="a group of individuals of one species in an area, though the size and nature of the area is defined, often arbitrarily, for the purposes of the study being undertaken" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - population">population</span> to describe a group of individuals of one species. What actually constitutes a population, though, varies from species to species and from study to study. In some cases, the boundaries of a population are obvious: the sticklebacks occupying a small lake are ‘the stickleback population of the lake.’ In other cases, boundaries are determined more by an investigator’s purpose or convenience. Thus, we may study the population of lime aphids inhabiting one leaf, one tree, one stand of trees, or a whole woodland. In all cases, though, the most fundamental characteristic of a population is the number of individuals that compose it: populations grow or decline by changes in those numbers.</p>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c05-feafxd-0003">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">birth, death, and movement change the size of populations</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The processes that change the size of populations are birth, death, and movement (either into or out of that population). Trying to understand changes in population size is important because ecology is concerned not just with comprehending nature but often also with predicting or controlling it. We might, for example, wish to reduce the size of a population of rabbits that can do serious harm to crops. We might do this by increasing the death rate by introducing the myxomatosis virus to the population, or by decreasing the birth rate by offering them food that contains a contraceptive. We might encourage their emigration by bringing in dogs, or prevent their immigration by fencing.</p>
<p class="para indent">Similarly, a nature conservationist may wish to increase the population of a rare endangered species. In the 1970s, a rapid decline became apparent in the numbers of bald eagles and other birds of prey in the United States. This might have occurred because their birth rate had fallen, or their death rate had risen, or patterns or rates of movement had changed. Eventually the decline was traced to reduced birth rates. The insecticide DDT was widely used at the time (it is now banned in the United States, although it is still widely used in many developing countries) and had been absorbed by many species on which the birds preyed. As a result, it accumulated in the bodies of the birds themselves, leading the shells of their eggs to become so thin that the chicks often died before hatching (discussed further in <span id="widget-62645" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62645" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62645"></div>). Conservationists charged with helping populations of the bald eagle to recover had to find a way to increase the birds’ birth rate. The banning of DDT did this.<p></p>

If we want to know how many fish there are in a pond, we might obtain an accurate count by putting in poison and counting the dead bodies. But apart from the questionable morality of doing this, we usually want to continue studying a population after we have counted it. It is not too difficult to count the numbers of large mammals such as deer on an isolated island. And occasionally it may be possible to trap alive all the individuals in a population, count them, and then release them. With birds, for example, it may be possible to mark all nestlings in a small woodland with leg rings, and subsequently recognize every individual (except immigrants) in the population. But it is very much more difficult to count the numbers of lemmings in a patch of tundra, or even trap them, because they spend a large part of the year (and may reproduce) under thick snow cover. And most other species are so small, or cryptic, or hidden, or fast moving that they are even more difficult to count.</p>

For example, we might capture and mark 100 individuals from a population of sparrows and release them back into the population. If we later sample a further 100 individuals from the population and find half are marked, we could argue in the following way. Half the sample are marked; the sample is representative of the whole population; therefore, half the population are marked; 100 individuals were given a mark; therefore, the whole population is composed of about 200 individuals. In practice, however, there are many pitfalls in the sampling process and in interpretation of the data. If, for example, many of the individuals we marked died between our first and second visits, then modifications of the method would be needed to take account of this.

The life histories of all unitary organisms can be seen as variations around this simple pattern, though a post-reproductive period (as seen in humans) is probably rather unusual.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Some organisms fit several or many generations within a single year, some have just one generation each year (annuals), and others (ourselves, perennial plants, etc.) have a life cycle extended over several or many years. For all organisms, though, a period of growth occurs before there is any reproduction, and growth usually slows down (and in some cases stops altogether) when reproduction starts. Growth and reproduction both require resources and there is clearly some conflict between them. Thus, as the perennial plant <span class="txt-italic">Sparaxis grandiflora</span> enters its reproductive stage in the Southwestern Cape, South Africa, flowers, flower stalks, and fruit (aspects of reproduction) can be seen to have been produced <span class="txt-italic">at the expense</span> of roots and leaves (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fig-0005">Figure 5.5</a>). There are also many plants (e.g., foxgloves) that spend their first year in vegetative growth, and then flower and die in the second or a later year (called ‘biennial’ plants). But if the flowers of these species are removed before their seeds begin to set, the plants usually survive to the following year, when they flower again and set seed even more vigorously. It seems to be the cost of provisioning the offspring (seeds) rather than flowering itself that is lethal. Similarly, pregnant women are advised to increase their caloric intake by as much as half their normal consumption: when nutrition is inadequate, pregnancy can harm the health of the mother.</p>

We ourselves are iteroparous.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Annual life cycles</h2>
<p class="para">In strongly seasonal, temperate latitudes, most annuals germinate or hatch as temperatures start to rise in spring, grow rapidly, reproduce, and then die before the end of summer. The European common field grasshopper <span class="txt-italic">Chorthippus brunneus</span> is an example of an annual species that is iteroparous. It emerges from its egg in late spring and passes through four juvenile stages of nymph before becoming adult in midsummer and dying by mid-November. During their adult life, the females reproduce repeatedly, each time laying egg pods containing about 11 eggs, and recovering and actively maintaining their bodies between the bursts of reproduction.</p>
<p class="para indent">Many annual plants, by contrast, are semelparous: they have a sudden burst of flowering and seed set, and then they die. This is commonly the case among the weeds of arable crops. Others, such as groundsel, are iteroparous: they continue to grow and produce new flowers and seeds through the season until they are killed by the first lethal frost of winter. They die with their buds on.</p>
<p class="para indent">Most annuals spend part of the year dormant as seeds, spores, cysts, or eggs. In many cases these dormant stages may remain viable for many years; there are reliable records of seeds of the annual weeds <span class="txt-italic">Chenopodium album</span> and <span class="txt-italic">Spergula arvensis</span> remaining viable in soil for 1600 years. Similarly, the dried eggs of brine shrimps remain viable for many years in storage. This means that if we measure the length of life from the time of formation of the zygote, many so-called ‘annual’ animals and plants live very much longer than a single year. Large populations of dormant seeds form a <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c05-tdef-0005" title="the population of viable dormant seeds that accumulates in and on soil and in sediments under water" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - seed bank">seed bank</span> buried in the soil: as many as 86,000 viable seeds per square meter have been found in cultivated soils.

Seven species groups (GR1-GR7) are defined on the basis of whether they were found in only one, two, or all three life stages. The marked difference in composition, especially between the seed bank and the mature vegetation, is readily apparent, in that 32 species in the mature vegetation (19 + 13) were not represented in the seed bank, while 33 species in the seed bank (29 + 4) were not found in the mature vegetation, and 29 of these were not found as seedlings either. <span class="source">(After Jutila, 2003<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0303">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0303</a>-->.)</span>

Salmon are spawned in rivers. They spend the first phase of their juvenile life in fresh water and then migrate to the sea, often travelling thousands of miles. At maturity they return to the stream in which they were hatched. Some mature and return to reproduce after only 2 years at sea; others mature more slowly and return after 3, 4, or 5 years. At the time of reproduction the population of salmon is composed of overlapping generations of individuals.

<p class="para indent">A different approach is necessary when we cannot follow cohorts but we know the ages of all the individuals in a population (perhaps from some clue such as the condition of the teeth in a species of deer).

The first data column of the static life table thus comprises the series 3, 2, 2, 0. This amounts to saying that over these time intervals, a typical cohort will have started with three and declined over successive time intervals to two, then two again, then zero.</p>

<p class="para indent">The first column in each life table is a list of the stages or age classes of the organism’s life: for <span class="txt-italic">Gilia</span> these are the simple stages ‘seed,’ ‘emerged plants,’ and ‘flowering plants,’ and for the marmots, years. The second column is then the raw data from each study, collected in the field. It reports the number of individuals surviving to the beginning of each stage or age class (see <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fea-0002">Box 5.2</a>).</p>
<p class="para indent">Ecologists are typically interested not just in examining populations in isolation but in comparing the dynamics of two or more perhaps rather different populations.

Its value is 38.29 for the inland subspecies and 11.47 for the coastal subspecies: a clear indication that the inland subspecies thrived, comparatively, at this inland site. (Though the annual rate of reproduction would not have been this high, since, no doubt, a proportion of these would have died before the start of the 1994 cohort.

The details of that calculation are beyond our scope here, but its value, 4.5 years, matches what we can observe ourselves in the life table: that a ‘typical’ period from an individual’s birth to giving birth itself (i.e., a generation) is around four and a half years.

<p class="para indent">It is possible to see, therefore, even from these two examples, how life tables can be useful in characterizing the ‘health’ of a population—the extent to which it is growing or declining—and identifying where in the life cycle, and whether it is survival or birth, that is apparently most instrumental in determining that rate of increase or decline. Either or both of these may be vital in determining how best to conserve an endangered species or control a pest.</p>
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Life tables for populations with overlapping generations</h2>
<p class="para">Many of the species for which we have important questions, and for which life tables may provide an answer, have repeated breeding seasons like the marmots, or continuous breeding as in the case of humans, but constructing life tables here is complicated, largely because these populations have individuals of many different ages living together. Building a cohort life table is sometimes possible, as we have seen, but this is relatively uncommon. Apart from the mixing of cohorts in the population, it can be difficult simply because of the longevity of many species.</p>

<p class="para">Birth is only the beginning. If we were to stop there in our studies, many crucial ecological questions would remain unanswered. From their place of birth, all organisms move to locations where we eventually find them. Plants grow where their seeds fall, but seeds may have been moved by the wind, water, animals, or shifting soil. Animals move in search of food and safe havens, whether it is to move only one centimeter along a leaf from where their egg was deposited, or halfway around the globe. The effects of those movements are varied. In some cases they aggregate members of a population into clumps; in others they continually redistribute and shuffle them; and in still others they spread the individuals out. Three generalized spatial patterns that result from this movement—aggregated (clumped), random, and regular (evenly) spaced—are illustrated in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fig-0014">Figure 5.14</a>.

<p class="para indent">Our view of dispersal and migration, and of the resulting distributions, is determined by the scale on which we are working. For example, consider the distribution of an aphid living on a particular species of tree in a woodland. On a large scale, the aphids appear to be aggregated in the woodlands and nonexistent in the open fields.

In a long-term and intensive investigation of a population of great tits, <span class="txt-italic">Parus major</span>, near Oxford, England, it was observed that 57% of breeding birds were immigrants rather than born in the population (Greenwood et al., 1978<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0217">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0217</a>-->).

Indeed, most populations are more affected by immigration and emigration than is commonly imagined. Within the United States, for example, it is said that over 40% of U.S. residents, over 100 million people, can trace their roots to the 12 million immigrants who entered the United States through the Ellis Island port from 1870 to 1920.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">The role of migration</h2>
<p class="para">The mass movements of populations that we call migration are almost always from regions where the food resource is declining to regions where it is abundant (or where it will be abundant for the progeny). By day, some planktonic algae live in the upper layers of the water in lakes where the light needed for photosynthesis is brightest. At night, they migrate to lower, nutrient-rich depths. Crabs migrate along the shore with the tides, following the movement of their food supply as it is washed up in the waves. At longer time scales, some shepherds still follow the ages-old practice of ‘transhumance,’ moving their flocks of sheep and goats up to mountain pastures in summer and down again in the fall to track the seasonal changes in climate and food supply.</p>
<p class="para indent">The long-distance migrations of terrestrial birds in many cases involve movement between areas that supply abundant food, but only for a limited time. They are areas in which seasons of comparative glut and famine alternate, and that cannot support large all-year-round resident populations. For example, swallows (<span class="txt-italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) migrate seasonally from northern Europe in the fall, when flying insects start to become rare, to South Africa when they are becoming common. In both areas the food supply that is reliable throughout the year can support only a small population of resident species. The seasonal glut supports the populations of invading migrants, which make a large contribution to the diversity of the local fauna.</p>

<p class="para"><span class="txt-italic">The competing priorities of aiding otter recovery and support for ailing coastal fishing communities appear on a collision course. But sea otters are more than just our cute competition</span>.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="txt-bold">February 21, 2012</span> | <span class="txt-italic">By James A. Estes</span></p>
<p class="para">Sea otters once abounded in coastal waters around the North Pacific Coast from Russia to Mexico. Over decades, they were hunted to near-extinction as a popular target of the maritime fur trade. Yet their dramatic brush with extinction, along with their intrinsically appealing characteristics, has provided a powerful emotional foundation for otter recovery efforts in the United States.</p>
<p class="para indent">While these conservation initiatives have shown impressive results, they have also created conflicts with fishermen over valuable shellfish resources such as clams, mussels and abalone, traditional food sources for these small predators. The competing priorities of aiding otter recovery and support for ailing coastal fishing communities appear on a collision course.</p>
<p class="para indent">The seemingly conflicting values of preserving an important element of nature’s biodiversity versus our reluctance to incur the associated costs can be at least partly resolved through a better understanding of the greater ecological services provided by many of these animals. Otters, now at the center of some rather large national policy debates, offer an example.</p>
<p class="para indent">Leaders in Washington are considering several important but highly contentious and contrasting policy decisions. One is a proposal by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to eliminate the 24-year-old Southern California ‘no-otter zone’ designation under which any otters are captured and relocated. At the same time, a bill in Congress would allow resumption of trade in fur from sea otters that are trapped for subsistence in southeast Alaska, in an effort to reduce the competition between humans and otters over key local shellfish fisheries.</p>
<p class="para indent">In nearly every case in which recovery of a predator is occurring or has been proposed, the policy debate is framed as a contrast between ethical and monetary values: a choice between our hearts and our wallets. Yet the many scientifically known and suspected positive influences of these animals on the health of regional ecosystems are all too often overlooked. Indeed, research has shown that these ecological services provide very real dollars-and-cents benefits for society that policymakers should take into consideration.</p>
<p class="para indent">For instance, kelp forests are the foundation of many North Pacific marine ecosystems. These wildernesses of the deep support regional fish populations, serving both as a vital habitat and a source of nourishment for many species. Perhaps even more important, research indicates that these forests also provide humans with a number of crucial natural services. Their role in helping to buffer shorelines from wave exposure, reducing rates of coastal erosion and shoreline recession, is just one example. And sea otters are essential to keeping these coastal kelp forests healthy.</p>
<p class="para indent">Much like the way wolves cull deer and elk populations on land, sea otters eat urchins. But when otter populations are allowed to plummet, urchins are left unchecked. Without any natural predators, urchins can become so numerous that they overgraze the lush kelp forests that otherwise abound along the West Coast. When this happens, the lost ecological benefits—both to society and the environment—are dramatic.</p>
<p class="para indent">An ever-growing body of research shows that the ecological and economic influences of predators in nature, from sea otters to wolves, extend well beyond the things they eat. Although debates over managing these species are likely to always be controversial, invoking deep passions on both sides, science provides the best basis for policy decisions, as it affords a common currency in valuing the perceived costs and benefits for predator conservation.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">Shellfisheries are of considerable importance to commercial, recreational, and tribal fishers. How would you weigh up the competing demands of conservation and fishing? Should the sea otters remain absolutely protected or is there a case for culling or some other form of control?</span></p>
<p class="para indent txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">Many of the arguments for conservation are based not simply on sentiment but on genuine ecological concerns. Should the public (and politicians) be better educated so as to appreciate those concerns? How might this be done? Or should the public (and politicians) simply take the advice of ecologists?</span></p>

<section class="section-5" id="c05-sec-0021">
<p class="para">In this box, simple mathematical models are derived for populations first in the absence of, and then under the influence of, intraspecific competition. These and other mathematical models play an important part in ecology (see <span id="widget-62664" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62664" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62664"></div>). They help us to follow through the consequences of assumptions we may wish to make, and to explore the behavior of ecological systems that we may find it hard to observe in nature or construct in the laboratory. The particular models in this box themselves form the basis for more complex models of <span class="txt-italic">interspecific</span> competition (competition between individuals of different species, <span id="widget-62665" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62665" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 6</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62665"></div></span>) and predation: they are important building blocks. It is essential to appreciate, however, that a pattern generated by such a model—for example, the S-shaped pattern of population growth under the influence of intraspecific competition—does not derive its interest, or its importance, from having been generated by the model. There are many other models that could generate very similar (indistinguishable) patterns. Rather, the point about the pattern is that it reflects important, underlying ecological processes—and the model is useful in that it appears to capture the essence of those processes.<p></p>

In these kinds of experiment it is easy to have experimental control of environmental conditions and resources. In the real world, outside the laboratory and the mind of the mathematician, the world is less simple. The complex life cycles of organisms, seasonal changes in conditions and resources, and the patchiness of habitats all introduce complications.

<p class="para indent">Another way to summarize the ways in which intraspecific competition affects populations is to look at <span class="txt-bold">net recruitment</span>—the number of births minus the number of deaths in a population over a period of time. When densities are low, net recruitment will be low because there are few individuals available either to give birth or to die. Net recruitment will also be low at much higher densities as the carrying capacity is approached. Net recruitment will be at its peak, then, at some intermediate density. The result is a ‘humped’ or dome-shaped curve (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fig-0024">Figure 5.24</a>). Again, of course, as with the ideal logistic curve, real data from nature never fall on a single line: indeed, sometimes the lines drawn through the data seem somewhat imaginative! But the dome-shaped curve reflects the essence of net recruitment patterns when density-dependent birth and death are the result of intraspecific competition.</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">First, though, we return to a point made earlier: that in any life history there is a limited total amount of energy (or some other resource) available to an organism for growth and reproduction. Some trade-off may therefore be necessary: either grow more and reproduce less, or reproduce more and grow less. Specifically, there may be an observable <span class="txt-bold">cost of reproduction</span> in that when reproduction starts, or increases, growth may slow or stop completely, as resources are diverted. We can, of course, look at this trade-off the other way around: an organism that makes vigorous growth, and so thrives in competition with its neighbors, may have to pay the price by reducing reproductive activity. In many forest trees, for example, growth rings in the trunk may be narrower in ‘mast’ years, when very heavy crops of seeds are produced (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fig-0025">Figure 5.25a</a>).

This is another example of a life history trade-off: an organism has limited resources available for reproduction, and natural selection will influence how these are packaged. In environments where rapid population growth is possible, those individuals that produce large numbers of small progeny will be favored. The size of progeny can be sacrificed because they will usually not be in competition with others. However, in environments in which the individuals are crowded and there is competition for resources, those progeny that are well provided with resources by the parent will be favored. Producing progeny that are well endowed requires the trade-off of producing fewer of them (see, for example, Figure<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c05-fig-0027">5.27</a>).</p>

<p class="para">The processes that change the size of populations are birth, death, and movement. A population is a number of individuals, but for some kinds of organisms, especially modular organisms, it is not always clear what we mean by an individual. The life histories of all unitary organisms can be seen as variations around a simple, sequential pattern, whether they be annuals or perennials, iteroparous or semelparous.</p>

<p class="para">Life tables can be useful in identifying what in a life cycle is apparently most instrumental in determining rates of increase or decline. A cohort life table records the survivorship of members of a single cohort. When we cannot follow cohorts, it may be possible to construct a static life table, but great care is required. The fecundity of individuals also changes with age, described in age-specific fecundity schedules. A useful set of survivorship curves (types 1–3) has been developed, but in practice patterns of survival are usually more complex.</p>

<p class="para">Dispersal is the way individuals spread away from each other. Migration is the mass directional movement of large numbers of a species from one location to another. Movement and spatial distribution are intimately related. Dispersal and migration can have a profound effect on the dynamics of a population and on its composition.</p>

<p class="para">Over a sufficiently large density range, competition between individuals generally reduces the birth rate as density increases and increases the death rate (i.e. is density-dependent). Intraspecific competition therefore tends to keep density within certain limits and may thus be said to play a part in regulating the size of populations. When populations are sparse and uncrowded they tend to exhibit exponential growth, but the rate of increase tends to become reduced by competition as the population grows, giving rise to population growth that is logistic. Intraspecific competition also affects net recruitment, typically resulting in a humped curve.</p>

<p class="para">There is typically a limited total amount of energy or some other resource available to an organism for growth and reproduction. There may thus be an observable cost of reproduction.

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">This chapter, then, is about both the ecological and the evolutionary effects of interspecific competition on individuals, on populations, and on communities. But it also addresses a more general issue in ecology and indeed in science—that there is a difference between what a process can do and what it <span class="txt-italic">does</span> do: a difference between what, in this case, interspecific competition is capable of doing and what it actually does in practice. These are two separate questions, and we must be careful to keep them separate.</p>
<p class="para indent">The way these different questions can be asked and answered will be different, too. To find out what interspecific competition is capable of doing is relatively easy. Species can be forced to compete in experiments, or they can be examined in nature in pairs or groups chosen precisely because they seem most likely to compete. But it is much more difficult to discover how important interspecific competition actually is. It will be necessary to ask how realistic our experiments are, and whether the pairs and groups of species we choose to study are really typical of pairs and groups more generally.</p>

The population densities of the different species were monitored over time as resources were continuously being added to the liquid medium, but their impact on their limiting resource (phosphorus) was also recorded. When any of the species was grown alone, it established a steady population density, reducing the phosphorus to a constant low concentration (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0001">Figure 6.1a</a>).

The Dolly Varden are distributed further upstream than the white-spotted charr. Water temperature, which has profound consequences for fish ecology, increases downstream. In streams where they occur together, there is a zone of overlap at intermediate altitudes, but in streams where one species is absent, the other expands its range beyond this intermediate zone.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In laboratory streams, higher temperatures (12°C as compared to 6°C) led to increased aggression in both species when they were tested alone, but these temperatures led to the Dolly Varden being <span class="txt-italic">less</span> aggressive when white-spotted charr were also present (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0002">Figure 6.2a</a>). Consequently, Dolly Varden charr failed to obtain favorable foraging positions when white-spotted charr were present at the higher temperature and so foraged far less effectively (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0002">Figure 6.2b</a>).

<p class="para indent">These results all support the idea that the lower altitudinal boundary of Dolly Varden charr in the Japanese streams was due to temperature-mediated competition favoring white-spotted charr, which were more aggressive, foraged more effectively, and grew far faster. But the Dolly Varden did not outcompete the white-spotted charr in any of the experiments, even at the lower temperatures. Thus, the results provide no evidence for the upper boundary of the white-spotted charr also being due to temperature-mediated competitive effects. Further work will be needed to determine why Dolly Varden exclude white-spotted charr upstream.</p>

Ornithologists, for example, are well aware that closely related species of birds often coexist in the same habitat. For example, four <span class="txt-italic">Sylvia</span> species (warblers) occur together on the Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0004">Figure 6.4</a>): Marmora’s warbler (<span class="txt-italic">Sylvia sarda</span>), the Dartford warbler (<span class="txt-italic">S. undata</span>), the Sardinian warbler (<span class="txt-italic">S. melanocephala</span>), and the Subalpine warbler (<span class="txt-italic">S. cantillans</span>). All look similar and all are insectivorous, with just the occasional use of berries or soft fruit; and all live in open bush-dominated landscapes, using the bushes there for nesting. Yet, the closer we look at the details of the ecology of such coexisting species, the more likely we are to find ecological differences. In Corsica and Sardinia, all four species are found in habitats with bushes of medium height; but where the bushes are lower, Marmora’s warblers are most often observed with Subalpine warblers largely absent, whereas the reverse is true where bushes are higher. And even within the particular habitat types, the species differ significantly in the different plant species and plant heights from which they prefer to forage (Martin &amp; Thibault, <!-- <a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0390">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0390</a> -->1996).

<p class="para">G. F. Gause was, by any measure, a quite remarkable scientist. Born in Moscow in 1910 into an academic family, he entered university in 1927 and graduated in 1931, but by 1928 was already undertaking field research, subsequently published, on the distribution of Russian grasshoppers. His tutor at university, Vladimir Alpatov, had around this time been visiting Raymond Pearl’s laboratory in the United States (Baltimore), where they studied ecology in laboratory microcosms, and Gause seems himself to have grasped, more or less immediately, the possibilities this opens up for teasing apart and elaborating the various forces acting on the abundance of populations, away from the complexities of the natural world. Alpatov had brought back fruit flies, <span class="txt-italic">Drosophila</span>, as ‘model organisms’ from Pearl’s laboratory, but he, and especially Gause, soon turned to microorganisms, yeast and protozoa, for their experimental material.</p>
<p class="para indent">These were early days for ecological modelling.

Part of Gause’s genius, and of his legacy to Ecology, was to see so clearly, and so early, how relatively simple, controlled, laboratory systems can form a bridge between mathematical models like these and the complexities of nature. Sometimes his experiments confirmed a model’s ability to capture the essence of an ecological pattern; but more often they revealed not so much the inadequacy of a model, but what precisely was required in a biological system for the model patterns to be apparent. His experiments were quickly published in two books: <span class="txt-italic">The Struggle for Existence</span> in 1934, and (in French) <span class="txt-italic">Experimental Verifications of the Mathematical Theory of the Struggle for Existence</span> in 1935.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">His 1934 book also focused the attention of ecologists onto what we now know as the Competitive Exclusion Principle, but what for many years usually had Gause’s name attached to it: Gause’s principle, Gause’s postulate, and so on. Charles Darwin had recognized it in his <span class="txt-italic">Origin of Species</span> and others had recognized a basic truth in it, but nobody previously had seriously understood that it could act as an organizing principle in the construction of ecological communities. Indeed, it was only after another ten years or so that the principle moved toward the center of the ecological stage, where it has, in one way or another, remained ever since.</p>
<p class="para indent">Yet, having established his legacy within Ecology so early in his career, Gause did not remain an ecologist. Perhaps because of a perceived need in the Soviet Union for their best scientists to be working on behalf of the State and the people, or perhaps because Gause simply felt it was time to move on, from the late 1930s his work had turned to studies of chemicals produced by microbes in their own struggle for existence. In 1942, with his wife, he discovered gramicidin S, the first original Soviet antibiotic, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize, and the rest of his life was devoted to the discovery and development of antibiotics. He was Director of the Institute of New Antibiotics in Moscow when he died in 1986.

<p class="para indent">The principle has emerged here from examining patterns evident in real sets of data. However, the establishment of the principle had its roots in a simple mathematical model of interspecific competition, usually known by the names of its two (independent) originators: Lotka and Volterra (Quantitative <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fea-0002">Box 6.2</a>).</p>

<p class="para indent">In order to determine the outcome of competition in this model, it is necessary to determine, at each point on a figure, the behavior of the joint species 1—species 2 population, as indicated by the pair of arrows. There are, in fact, four different ways in which the two zero isoclines can be arranged relative to one another, and these can be distinguished by the intercepts of the zero isoclines on the two axes of the graph (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0008">Figure 6.8</a>).

<p class="para indent">In this case, both species have less competitive effect on the other species than those other species have on themselves. In this sense, both are weak interspecific competitors. This would happen, for example, if there were niche differentiation between the species – each competed mostly ‘within’ its own niche. The outcome, as <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0008">Figure 6.8c</a> shows, is that all arrows point towards a stable, equilibrium combination of the two species, which all joint populations therefore tend to approach. That is, the outcome of this type of competition is the stable coexistence of the competitors. Indeed, it is only this type of competition (both species having more effect on themselves than on the other species) that does lead to the stable coexistence of competitors.</p>

<p class="para">Thus, individuals of both species have a greater competitive effect on individuals of the other species than those other species do on themselves. This will occur, for instance, when each species is more aggressive toward individuals of the other species than toward individuals of its own species. The directions of the arrows are rather more complicated in this case, but eventually they always lead to one or other of two alternative stable points. At the first, species 1 reaches its carrying capacity with species 2 extinct; at the second, species 2 reaches its carrying capacity with species 1 extinct. In other words, both species are capable of driving the other species to extinction, but which actually does so cannot be predicted with certainty. It depends on which species has the upper hand in terms of densities, either because they start with a higher density or because density fluctuations in some other way give them that advantage. Whichever species has this upper hand capitalizes on that and drives the other species to extinction.</p>

<p class="para indent">There is no question that there is some truth in the principle that competitor species can coexist as a result of niche differentiation, and that one competitor species may exclude another by denying it a realized niche.

<p class="para">The Competitive Exclusion Principle—what it does and does not say</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">It does <span class="txt-italic">not</span> say that whenever we see coexisting species with different niches, it is reasonable to jump to the conclusion that this is the principle in operation. All species, on close inspection, have their own unique niches. Niche differentiation does not prove that there are coexisting competitors. The species may not be competing at all and may never have done so in their evolutionary history. We require proof of interspecific competition. In the examples above, this was provided by experimental manipulation – for example, remove one species (or one group of species) and the other species increases its abundance or its survival. But most cases for competitors coexisting as a result of niche differentiation have not been subjected to experimental proof. So just how important is the Competitive Exclusion Principle in practice? We return to this question in <span id="widget-62690" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62690" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 6.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62690"></div>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Part of the problem is that although species may not be competing now, their ancestors may have competed in the past, so that the mark of interspecific competition is left imprinted by evolution on either their niches, or their behavior, or their morphology. This particular question is taken up in <span id="widget-62691" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62691" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 6.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62691"></div>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Finally, the Competitive Exclusion Principle, as stated above, includes the word ‘stable.’ That is, in the habitats envisaged in the principle, conditions and the supply of resources remain more or less constant – if species compete, then that competition runs its course, either until one of the species is eliminated, or until the species settle into a pattern of coexistence within their realized niches. Sometimes this is a realistic view of a habitat, especially in laboratory or other controlled environments where the experimenter consciously <span class="txt-italic">holds</span> conditions and the supply of resources constant. However, most environments are not stable for long periods of time. How does the outcome of competition change when environmental heterogeneity in space and time are taken into consideration? This is the subject of the next section.</p>

<p class="para">competition may only rarely ‘run its course’</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">As explained in previous chapters, spatial and temporal variations in environments are the norm rather than the exception. Environments are usually a patchwork of favorable and unfavorable habitats; patches are often only available temporarily; and patches often appear at unpredictable times and in unpredictable places. Under such variable conditions, competition may only rarely ‘run its course,’ and the outcome cannot be predicted simply by application of the Competitive Exclusion Principle. A species that is a ‘weak’ competitor in a constant environment might, for example, be good at colonizing open gaps created in a habitat by fire, or a storm, or the hoofprint of a cow in the mud—or may be good at growing rapidly in such gaps immediately after they are colonized. It may then coexist with a strong competitor, as long as new gaps occur frequently enough. Thus, a realistic view of interspecific competition must acknowledge that it often proceeds not in isolation, but under the influence of, and within the constraints of, a patchy, cyclical, impermanent, or even unpredictable world.</p>
<p class="para indent">The following examples illustrate just two of the many ways in which environmental heterogeneity ensures that the Competitive Exclusion Principle is very far from being the whole story when it comes to determining the outcome of an interaction between competing species.</p>

In fact, theory predicts that the diversity of coexisting species should be proportional to the number of resources in a system that are at physiological limiting levels (Tilman, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0582">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0582</a>-->1982): the more limiting resources, the more coexisting competitors. A direct test of this hypothesis examined three lakes in the Yellowstone region of Wyoming, using an index (Simpson’s index) of the species diversity of phytoplankton there (diatoms and other species). If one species exists on its own, the index equals 1; in a group of species where biomass is strongly dominated by a single species, the index will be close to 1; when two species exist at equal biomass, the index is 2; and so on. According to the theory, therefore, this index should increase in direct proportion to the number of resources limiting growth. The spatial and temporal patterns in phytoplankton diversity in the three lakes for 1996 and 1997 are shown in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0015">Figure 6.15a</a>.<p></p>

These parameters were measured at the same depths and times that the phytoplankton were sampled, and it was noted where and when any of the potential limiting factors actually occurred at levels below threshold limits for growth.

<p class="para">The region near Madang in Papua, New Guinea, has the highest reported species richness of both anemone fish (nine) and of sea anemones with which they are associated (10). Anemones seem to be a limiting resource for the fish in that almost all anemones are occupied, and if some are transplanted to new sites, they are quickly colonized. However, each individual anemone tends to be occupied by individuals of just one species of anemone fish, because the residents aggressively exclude intruders, though aggressive interactions are less frequently observed between anemone fish of very different sizes (likely reflecting their differing food particle sizes). Surveys in four zones (nearshore, mid-lagoon, outer barrier reef, and offshore: <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0016">Figure 6.16a</a>) showed that each species of anemone fish was primarily associated with a particular species of anemone.

Crucially, though, anemone fish that lived with the same anemone were typically associated with different zones. For example, <span class="txt-italic">Amphiprion percula</span> occupied the anemone <span class="txt-italic">Heteractis magnifica</span> in nearshore zones, but the related <span class="txt-italic">A. perideraion</span> occupied <span class="txt-italic">H. magnifica</span> in offshore zones.

That is, niche differentiation in a community of species involves several niche dimensions, with fish species occupying a similar position along one dimension tending to differ along another dimension, be it species of anemone, zone on the shore, or food particle size (reflected in the size of the fish).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Species separated in space or in time</h2>
<p class="para">We have seen that there is commonly, but not necessarily, an association between niche differentiation and the coexistence of species within natural communities, and that niches may be differentiated through resource partitioning or differential resource utilization. In many cases, the resources used by ecologically similar species are separated spatially. Differential resource utilization will then express itself as either a microhabitat differentiation between the species (different species of fish, say, feeding at different depths) or even a difference in geographic distribution. Alternatively, the availability of the different resources may be separated in time. Different resources may become available at different times of the day or in different seasons, and differential resource utilization will then express itself as a temporal separation between the species.</p>
<p class="para indent">Alternatively, niches may be differentiated on the basis of conditions. Two species may use precisely the same resources, but if their ability to do so is influenced by environmental conditions (as it is bound to be), and if they respond differently to those conditions, then each may be competitively superior in different environments. This too can express itself as either a microhabitat differentiation, or a difference in geographic distribution, or a temporal separation, depending on whether the appropriate conditions vary on a small spatial scale, a large spatial scale or over time.</p>

<p class="para">A study of 11 tree species in the genus <span class="txt-italic">Macaranga</span> in Borneo showed marked differentiation in light requirements, from extremely light-demanding species to the strongly shade-tolerant.

Other species were of intermediate height and were associated with intermediate light levels and can be considered small-gap specialists (e.g., <span class="txt-italic">M. trachyphylla</span>). The species were also differentiated along a second niche gradient, with some species being more common on clay-rich soils and others on sand-rich soils (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0017">Figure 6.17</a>). Hence, as with the anemone fish, there was evidence of niche complementarity: species with similar light requirements tended to differ in terms of preferred soil textures and vice versa. In addition, though, this niche partitioning expressed itself as a differentiation in space, partly horizontally (variation in soil types and in light levels from place to place) and partly vertically (height in the canopy, depth of the root mat).</p>

Thus, tundra plants growing in nitrogen-limited conditions in Alaska are differentiated in their timing of nitrogen uptake, as well as in the soil depth from which nitrogen is extracted and the chemical form of nitrogen used.

Cottongrass (<span class="txt-italic">Eriophorum vaginatum</span>) and the cranberry bush (<span class="txt-italic">Vaccinium vitis-idaea</span>) both relied on a combination of glycine and ammonium, but cranberry obtained more of these forms early in the growing season and at a shallower depth than cottongrass.

<p class="para indent">Though deserts are hot and dry, they aren’t normally much of a fire hazard because the vegetation is so sparse there isn’t much to burn or any way for blazes to spread.</p>
<p class="para indent">But, underneath these blackened creosote branches, the cause of the fire seven years ago has already grown back: flammable grasses fill the empty spaces between the native bushes, creating a fuse for the fire to spread again.</p>
<p class="para indent">Tens of thousands of acres in the Mojave and other southwestern deserts have burned in the last decade, fueled by the red brome, cheat grass and Sahara mustard, tiny grasses and plants that grow back faster than any native species and shouldn’t be there in the first place.</p>

And, once an area is cleared of native vegetation by one or repeated fires, the grasses grow in even thicker, sometimes outcompeting native wildflowers and shrubs.</p>
<p class="para indent">… ‘These grasses could change the entire makeup of the Mojave Desert in short order’, said William Schlesinger of Duke University, who has studied the Mojave Desert for more than 25 years. When he began his research in the 1970s, the grasses were in the Mojave, but there still were vast areas left untouched. Now, he said, the grasses are virtually everywhere and soon will be in concentrations large enough to fuel massive fires. ‘This is not an easy problem to solve’, he said.</p>
<p class="para indent">… Despite the harsh conditions, a rainbow of wildflowers blooms regularly in the desert, sometimes carpeting the ground with blossoms after a rainstorm.

<p class="para indent">In a broader sense, however, the significance of interspecific competition rests not on a limited number of high-profile effects, but on an answer to the question ‘How widespread are the ecological and evolutionary consequences of interspecific competition in practice?’ We address this question in two ways. First, we ask ‘How prevalent is current competition in natural communities?’ Answering this, demonstrating current competition, requires experimental field manipulations, in which one species is removed from or added to the community and the responses of the other species are monitored. However, even if current competition is <span class="txt-italic">not</span> prevalent, past competition, and therefore competition generally, may still have played a significant role in structuring communities. The second question, then, is to distinguish between interspecific competition (past <span class="txt-italic">or</span> present) and ‘mere chance’: species differing not as a reflection of interspecific competition but simply because they <span class="txt-italic">are</span> different species. Patterns observed in nature can be examined to see if they provide strong evidence for a role for competition, or are open to alternative interpretations.</p>

</aside>
<p class="para">There have been several surveys of field experiments on interspecific competition over the years. Two early and very influential ones, by Schoener and by Connell, were both published in 1983. Schoener (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0526">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0526</a>-->1983) examined the results of all the experiments he could find—164 in all. Studies of freshwater organisms, and amongst terrestrial studies those dealing with phytophagous (plant-eating) insects, were relatively underrepresented. Any conclusions were therefore limited, to a degree, by what ecologists had chosen to look at. Nevertheless, Schoener found that approximately 90% of the studies had demonstrated the existence of interspecific competition. Moreover, even if he looked at small groups of species (of which there were 390) rather than at whole studies, which may have dealt with several groups of species, he found that 76% showed effects of competition at least sometimes. Connell’s (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0106">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0106</a>-->1983) review was less extensive than Schoener’s: 72 studies, dealing with a total of 215 species and 527 different experiments. Interspecific competition was demonstrated in most of the studies, more than half of the species and approximately 40% of the experiments. A subsequent survey, using more sophisticated forms of analysis of multiple, disparate studies (‘meta-analysis’) reached essentially similar conclusions (Gurevitch et al., <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0221">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0221</a>-->1992).</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="para">… though these surveys may exaggerate the true frequency of competition</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Taken together, these reviews certainly seem to indicate that active, current interspecific competition is widespread. Connell also found, however, that in studies of just one pair of species, interspecific competition was almost always apparent, whereas with more species the prevalence dropped markedly (from more than 90% to less than 50%). In part, this is a result of many pairs of species being chosen for study because competition between them is suspected, whereas if none is found, this is simply not reported. Judging the prevalence of competition from such studies is rather like judging the prevalence of debauchery amongst clergymen from the ‘gutter press.’ The results of these surveys are likely to exaggerate, to an unknown extent, the frequency of competition.</p>
<p class="para indent">Nonetheless, evidence for interspecific competition has been strong even in surveys of studies on groups often suspected of being little influenced by competition. Phytophagous (plant-eating) insects, in particular, have in the past been quoted as a group within which the forces of interspecific competition are weak. Yet, of 333 interactions from 145 experimental studies that satisfied criteria of rigor and experimental design for inclusion in a meta-analysis, 205 (62%) provided evidence of interspecific competition (Kaplan &amp; Denno, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0307">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0307</a>-->2007). Moreover, using those cases where it was possible to make a comparison, the effects of interspecific competition, while less, were not significantly less than those of intraspecific competition (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0020">Figure 6.20a</a>); and competition between species from different guilds, while less, was not significantly less than that between species in the same guild (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0020">Figure 6.20b</a>). It was also telling that competitive effects were strongest when there was neither spatial nor temporal separation between the species but also detectable when their niches were separated in either or both of these ways (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0020">Figure 6.20c</a>). And finally, out of 231 competitive interactions where it was possible to decide, 30 were the result of direct interference between competing individuals, 47 were the result of exploitation of the plant food diminishing the quantity of resource available to the competing species, but 116 were the indirect result of exploitation diminishing the <span class="txt-italic">quality</span> of food available for the other species.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Competition or mere chance?</h2>
<p class="para">There is a tendency to interpret differences between the niches of coexisting species as confirming the importance of interspecific competition. But the theory of interspecific competition predicts not simply that the niches of competing species differ, but that they differ more than would be expected from chance alone. A rigorous investigation of the role of interspecific competition must therefore address the question: ‘Does the observed pattern, even if it appears to implicate competition, differ significantly from the sort of pattern that could arise in the community even in the absence of any interactions between species?’ This question has been the driving force behind analyses that seek to compare real communities with so-called neutral or <span class="txt-bold">null models</span>. The idea is that the data are rearranged into a form (the null model) representing what the data would look like in the absence of interspecific competition. Then, if the actual data show a significant statistical difference from the null model, the action of interspecific competition is strongly inferred. Hence, the null model analyses are attempts to follow a much more general approach to scientific investigation, namely, the construction and testing of ‘null hypotheses.’</p>

<p class="para indent">In fact, the approach has been applied to three different predictions of what a community structured by interspecific competition should look like: (i) potential competitors that coexist in a community should exhibit niche differentiation; (ii) this niche differentiation will often manifest itself as morphological differentiation; and (iii) within a community, potential competitors with little or no niche differentiation should not coexist, so each should tend to occur only where the other is absent (‘negatively associated distributions’). The application of null models to community structure—that is, the reconstruction of natural communities with interspecific competition removed—has not been achieved to the satisfaction of all ecologists. But a brief examination of a very early study of niche differentiation in lizard communities shows the potential and rationale of the null model approach (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fea-0004">Box 6.4</a>).

For each community, there were estimates of the amounts of each of 20 food categories consumed by each species. This pattern of resource use allowed the calculation, for each pair of species in a community, of an index of <span class="txt-italic">resource use overlap</span>, which varied between 0 (no shared food categories) and 1 (perfect correspondence between a pair of species in the proportions of different foods used).

<p class="para indent">A number of ‘null models’ of these communities were then created. They were of four types. The first type, for example, retained the minimum amount of original community structure. Only the original number of species and the original number of resource categories were retained. Beyond that, species were allocated food preferences completely at random, such that there were far fewer species completely ignoring food in particular categories than in the real community. Hence, species tended to be categorized as eating a far broader range of food items than they do naturally, and pairs would therefore be expected to overlap more. At the other extreme, the fourth type retained most of the original community structure. If a species ignored food in a particular category, then that was left unaffected, but among those categories where food was eaten, preferences were reassigned at random. These null models were then compared with the real data in terms of their patterns of resource use overlap. If competition is a significant force in determining community structure, then resource use overlap in the real communities should be less – and statistically significantly less—than that in the null models.</p>

If these four are compared, they have a consistent length ratio (largest: next largest, etc.) of around 1.5 (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c06-fig-0022">Figure 6.22</a>). However, when groups of four species were drawn at random from the complete fauna 100,000 times, and the size ratios between adjacent species calculated, these ratios tended to be much smaller.

<p class="para indent">This kind of pattern—sometimes a role for competition is confirmed, sometimes not—has been the general conclusion from the null model approach. What then should be our verdict on it? Perhaps most fundamentally, the aim of the null model approach is undoubtedly worthy. It concentrates the minds of investigators, stopping them from jumping to conclusions too readily. It is important to guard against the temptation to see competition in a community simply because we are looking for it. On the other hand, the approach can never take the place of a detailed understanding of the field ecology of the species in question, or of manipulative experiments designed to reveal competition by increasing or reducing species abundances. It, like so many other approaches, can only be part of the community ecologist’s armory.</p>

<p class="para">The essence of interspecific competition is that individuals of one species suffer a reduction in fecundity, survivorship, or growth as a result of exploitation of resources or interference by individuals of another species. A fundamental niche is the combination of conditions and resources that allow a species to exist when considered in isolation from any other species. Its realized niche is the combination of conditions and resources that allow it to exist in the presence of other species that might be harmful to its existence—especially interspecific competitors. The Competitive Exclusion Principle states that if two competing species coexist in a stable environment, then they do so as a result of differentiation of their realized niches. Environments are usually a patchwork of favorable and unfavorable habitats; patches are often only available temporarily; and patches often appear at unpredictable times and in unpredictable places. Under such variable conditions, competition may only rarely ‘run its course.’</p>

<p class="para">Although species may not be competing now, their ancestors may have competed in the past. We can expect species to have evolved characteristics that ensure that they compete less, or not at all, with members of other species. Coexisting present-day competitors, and coexisting species that have evolved an avoidance of competition, can look, at least superficially, the same. It is impossible to prove an evolutionary effect of interspecific competition. However, careful observational studies have sometimes revealed patterns that are difficult to explain in any other way.</p>

<p class="para">Interspecific competition tends to structure communities by acting within guilds—groups of species exploiting the same class of resource in a similar fashion. Niche complementarity can be discerned in some communities, where coexisting species that occupy a similar position along one niche dimension tend to differ along another dimension. Niches can be differentiated through differential resource utilization or on the basis of conditions. Either can express itself as a microhabitat differentiation, or a difference in geographic distribution, or a temporal separation.</p>

<p class="para">Surveys of published studies of competition indicate that current competition is widespread but these exaggerate to an unknown extent the true frequency of competition. Theory predicts that the niches of competing species should be arranged regularly rather than randomly in niche space, that as a reflection of this they should be more distinct morphologically than expected by chance, and that competitors should be negatively associated in their distributions. Null models have been developed to determine what the community pattern would look like in the absence of interspecific competition. Real communities are sometimes structured in a way that makes an influence of competition difficult to deny.</p>

<p class="para">The fundamental similarity between true predators, grazers, and parasites is that each, in obtaining the resources it needs, reduces either the fecundity or the chances of survival of individual prey and may therefore reduce prey abundance. The effects of true predators on the survival of individual prey hardly need illustrating—the prey die. But the effects of grazers and parasites can be equally profound, if more subtle, as illustrated by the following two examples.</p>
<p class="para indent"><span class="txt-italic">Lathyrus vernus</span> is a long-lived perennial herb found in the forest understory throughout much of Europe. Molluscs, especially the slug <span class="txt-italic">Arion fasciatus</span>, often graze on emerging shoots of the plant, below the litter layer, early in the spring. The effects of this grazing have been monitored in southeast Sweden both naturally, through a direct comparison of grazed and ungrazed plants (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0001">Figure 7.1a</a>), and also through an experimental manipulation, in which plots that had all molluscs removed, followed by repeated molluscicide treatment, were compared with untreated control plots (<span id="widget-62706" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62706" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.1b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62706"></div>). The natural and experimental data tell very similar stories. Grazing had some effects on the subsequent survival of plants, on their tendency to remain dormant (not appearing above ground after grazing, but reappearing in the following season), and on their growth. But the largest effects of this early grazing were exhibited much later in the life cycle: on flowering and on the subsequent production of seeds. On the other hand, although these effects were the largest, they were not the ones that had the greatest effect on the overall rate of plant population increase, because the different processes themselves make very different contributions to population increase. In this respect it was the grazing effects on survival and growth that were most profound (<span id="widget-62707" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62707" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62707"></div></span>).

<p class="para indent"><span class="txt-italic">Philornis downsi</span> is a fly parasite whose larvae inhabit birds’ nests, chewing through the skin of nestlings and consuming blood and other fluids. They were seen first on the Galapagos Islands in 1997, where they attack a number of species including nine species of Darwin’s finches. One of these, the medium ground finch, <span class="txt-italic">Geospiza fortis</span>, has been the subject of field experiments to determine the effect of the parasite. Twenty-four nests constructed by the birds in tree cacti on Santa Cruz Island were fitted with a nylon liner to prevent the larvae reaching the nestlings from the nest material; a further 24 acted as unmanipulated (unlined) controls. The manipulation was only partially successful; there were around 22 <span class="txt-italic">P. downsi</span> larvae per lined nest compared to around 37 in the unlined ones. Nonetheless, the experiment demonstrated that parasitism by the larvae was adversely affecting the finch nestlings. The nestlings grew faster in lined than in unlined nests (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0002">Figure 7.2a</a>), and more lined nests fledged birds than unlined nests, while the total number of birds fledged from lined nests was also higher (<span id="widget-62708" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62708" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.2b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62708"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">It is not so straightforward, though, to demonstrate that reductions in the survival or fecundity of individual prey translate into reductions in prey abundance—we need to be able to compare prey populations in the presence and the absence of predators. As so often in ecology, we cannot rely simply on observation. We need experiments—either ones we set up ourselves, or natural experiments set up for us by nature.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Interactions with other factors</h2>
<p class="para">Grazers and parasites, in particular, often exert their harm not by killing their prey immediately like true predators, but by making the prey more vulnerable to some other form of mortality. For example, grazers and parasites may have a more drastic effect than is initially apparent because they decrease the competitive abilities of their victims. We see this in a southern Californian salt marsh, where the parasitic plant, dodder (<span class="txt-italic">Cuscuta salina</span>) attacks a number of plants including <span class="txt-italic">Salicornia</span> (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0004">Figure 7.4</a>). <span class="txt-italic">Salicornia</span> tends to be the strongest competitor in the marsh, but it is also the preferred host of dodder.

In a large field experiment, hares were live-trapped and fitted with tags that allowed them to be individually identified. Half were treated with a drug, ivermectin, to rid them of nematodes, while the other half acted as unmanipulated (parasitized) controls. A number of them were fitted with radio collars so they could be followed and their ultimate cause of death determined; 95% were eaten by predators, including coyotes, foxes, and several species of birds. The survival of parasitized and unparasitized hares in the face of this predation could then be compared.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In three of four runs of the experiment, there was no difference between the two groups (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0005">Figure 7.5a</a>), but in the fourth, the parasites greatly increased the hares’ vulnerability to predation. An explanation for this apparent inconsistency was then offered by a further experiment in which half the experimental field plots were provided with supplementary food for the hares (<span id="widget-62711" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62711" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.5b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62711"></div>).

<p class="para">The effects of parasites and grazers, however, are not always more profound than they first seem: they are often <span class="txt-italic">less</span> profound. For example, individual plants can compensate in a variety of ways for the effects of herbivory (Strauss &amp; Agrawal, 1999<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0560">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0560</a>-->). The removal of leaves from a plant may decrease the shading of other leaves and thereby increase their rate of photosynthesis. Or, following herbivore attack, many plants compensate by utilizing stored reserves. Often, there is compensatory regrowth of defoliated plants when buds that would otherwise remain dormant are stimulated to develop. There is also commonly a reduced subsequent death rate of surviving plant parts.</p>
<p class="para indent">For example, when herbivory on the biennial plant field gentian (<span class="txt-italic">Gentianella campestris</span>) was simulated by clipping to remove half its biomass (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0006">Figure 7.6a</a>), compensation was such that subsequent production of fruits could actually be increased (<span id="widget-62712" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62712" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.6b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62712"></div>). But this happened only if clipping took place at the time when damage by herbivores normally occurs, between July 12 and 20.

For example, a few weeks of grazing by snails (<span class="txt-italic">Littorina obtusata</span>) on the brown seaweed <span class="txt-italic">Ascophyllum nodosum</span> induced substantially increased concentrations of phlorotannins (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0007">Figure 7.7a</a>), which have a deterrent effect on snail grazing, as evidenced by the fact that they ate significantly less when offered grazed material than when offered ungrazed plants (<span id="widget-62713" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62713" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.7b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62713"></div>). Such induced responses take time to develop, but they can still be effective in reducing damage, either because the snails stay and feed on the same plant for long time periods, as here, or because other grazers move in to replace those that induced the response. Interestingly, simple clipping of the seaweeds did not have the same effect.<p></p>

But in order to obtain their benefit, the plants pay the cost of producing their protective chemicals.

Artificial damage, by contrast, induced no such protective effect. Moreover, despite the costs of making this response, the lifetime fitness of the caterpillar-grazed plants was 60% greater than that of the control plants (<span id="widget-62716" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62716" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.8c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62716"></div></span>), whereas artificially damaged plants (with no induced protection) had 38% <span class="txt-italic">lower</span> fitness, emphasizing the negative effect of tissue loss in its own right. This fitness benefit to caterpillar-grazed plants, however, occurred only when the other herbivores were present. In their absence, the costs of producing the chemicals outweighed the benefits: plants suffered a reduction in fitness (Karban et al., 1999<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0308">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0308</a>-->).

<p class="para">In spite of these various qualifications, the general rule is that predators are harmful to individual prey. But the effects of predation on a population of prey are not always so predictable. The most common reason is that the impact of predation is limited by compensatory reactions among the survivors as a result of reduced intraspecific competition. So, when food is short and competition intense, predation may relieve competitive pressures and allow individuals to survive that would not otherwise do so. The results of an experiment confirming this are shown in <a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0009">Figure 7.9</a>. The survival of grasshoppers (<span class="txt-italic">Ageneotettix deorum</span>) was monitored in caged plots with grass food that was either plentiful (fertilized plots) or limited (not fertilized), and in the presence or absence of predatory spiders. As predicted, with plentiful food, spider predation reduced the numbers surviving. But with limited food, spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; spiders ate grasshoppers, but this allowed other grasshoppers to survive, and so the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered at the end of the 31-day experiment.</p>

Many large carnivores, for example, concentrate their attacks on the old (and infirm), on the young (and naive) or on the sick. Thus, a study in the Serengeti found that cheetahs and wild dogs killed a disproportionate number from the younger age classes of Thomson’s gazelles (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0010">Figure 7.10a</a>) because: (i) these young animals were easier to catch (<span id="widget-62717" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62717" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.10b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62717"></div>); (ii) they had lower stamina and running speeds; (iii) they were less good at outmaneuvering the predators (<span id="widget-62718" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62718" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.10c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62718"></div></span>); and (iv) they may even have failed to recognize the predators.

<p class="para indent">Nonetheless, there is no doubt that predators can affect not only individual prey but also the abundance of whole prey populations. As so often in ecology, though, what is going on naturally may be apparent only if we intervene, in this case, by removing the predators and observing the response of the prey population. For example, field plots of the perennial shrub, the bush lupine, were established both in grassland and duneland habitats in California. These were either protected from, or exposed to, voles that ate their leaves, mice that ate their seeds, and insects that attacked their roots. Then, when the plant populations were followed for more than five years, the effects of these various herbivores on plant abundance were clear (<a class="link" href="file:///C:/Users/samha/Downloads/Essentials%20of%20Ecology%204th%20Edition/whole%20textbook.html#c07-fig-0011">Figure 7.11a</a>). With a single exception (the effects of rodents on adult plants in grasslands), both the insects and the rodents decreased the abundance of both adult plants and the number of seeds in the soil, and rodents and insects together depressed abundance even more than either did alone. In another experiment, voles were protected for two years from all predators, in a series of four one-hectare enclosures in Finland that were fenced and had net roofs. Their abundance increased more than 20-fold compared to control grids (<span id="widget-62719" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62719" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.11b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62719"></div>).

<p class="para">So far we have been looking at what happens <span class="txt-italic">after</span> a predator finds its prey. Now, we take a step back and examine how contact is established in the first place. This is crucially important, because this pattern of contact is critical in determining the predator’s consumption rate, which goes a long way to determining its own level of benefit and the harm it does to the prey, which determine, in turn, the impact on the dynamics of predator and prey populations.</p>
<p class="para indent">True predators and grazers typically forage. Many move around within their habitat in search of their prey, and their pattern of contact is therefore itself determined by the predators’ behavior—and sometimes by the evasive behavior of the prey (<span id="widget-62721" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62721" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.12a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62721"></div>). This foraging behavior is discussed below.

<p class="para">There are many questions we might ask about the behavior of a foraging predator. Where, within the habitat available to it, does it concentrate its foraging? How long does it tend to remain in one location before moving on to another? And so on. Ecologists address all such questions from two points of view.

We turn to this in <span id="widget-62728" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62728" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 7.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62728"></div>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The second is from the viewpoint of ‘optimal foraging.’ The aim is to seek to understand why particular patterns of foraging behavior have been favored by natural selection. We apply the same general approach as we would apply, for example, to the anatomy of the bird’s wing, where we might seek to understand why a particular surface area, or a particular arrangement of feathers, has been favored by natural selection for the effectiveness they bring to the bird’s powers of flight. Of course, nobody suggests that the birds have even a basic understanding of aerodynamics theory—only that those birds with the most effective wings have been favored in the past by natural selection and have passed their effectiveness on to their offspring. Likewise, in applying this approach to foraging behavior, there is no question of suggesting ‘conscious decision-making’ on the predator’s part.</p>
<p class="para indent">What, though, is the appropriate measure of ‘effectiveness’ in foraging behavior? For many aspects of foraging, though not all, the best measure is the <span class="txt-italic">net</span> rate of energy intake—that is, the amount of energy obtained per unit time, <span class="txt-italic">after</span> account has been taken of the energy expended by the predator in carrying out its foraging. Armed with this measure of effectiveness we can ask a number of questions, as follows.</p>
<p class="para indent">How long does a predator tend to remain in one location – one patch, say, of a patchy environment – before moving on to another, especially given that moving between patches is, in itself, unproductive? Details aside, we expect foragers simply to leave once they have depleted the patch to the point where they have more to gain by leaving (‘for pastures new’) than by staying, and this will take longest to do in the most productive patches. <span id="widget-62729" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62729" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.13a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62729"></div> shows evidence for such a pattern for bison foraging in patches of meadow (only 10% of the total habitat) in Price Albert National Park, Canada: they remained significantly longer in the more productive patches containing most of their preferred food, the sedge <span class="txt-italic">Carex atherodes</span>, since it took them longer there to deplete the patch to the point where it paid them to move.<p></p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="para indent">Next, what are the effects of other competing predators foraging in the same habitat? The expected net energy intake from a location is now presumably a reflection of both its intrinsic productivity and the number of competing foragers. How can we expect predators to distribute themselves over various habitat patches differing in their intrinsic productivity? <span id="widget-62730" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62730" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.13b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62730"></div> shows a commonly observed pattern of predator distribution (the so-called ‘ideal free distribution’), though in an uncommon setting: street children (predators) foraging for cars (prey) to whose drivers they can sell water. The foraging children distributed themselves between two lanes in the road in the same ratio as their prey, the cars. This is an optimal strategy in the sense that any child departing from this ratio (behaving suboptimally) would have experienced more competition and hence a lower intake of money.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Next, does the location chosen by a predator reflect just the energy intake it can expect there? Or does there appear to be some balancing of this against the risk of being preyed upon by its own predators? Balancing of risk is often apparent as, for example, for the large African herbivores in <span id="widget-62731" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62731" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.13c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62731"></div>. In the presence of lions, each showed an increased preference for foraging in grasslands, which might otherwise not have even been a preferred habitat, where the lions could more easily be seen and evasive action more easily taken.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">And finally here, there are questions of diet width. No predator can be capable physically of consuming all types of prey. However, most animals consume a narrower range of food types than they are morphologically capable of consuming. What determines what is included and excluded from a predator’s diet? Again putting details to one side, it should pay a predator always to include the most profitable prey type in its diet—profitable in terms of energy intake per unit time spent searching for and ‘handling’ its prey (pursuing, subduing, and consuming prey). But does it pay the predator then to add further items to its diet? The answer is that it should add the item as long as, having found it, its rate of energy intake handling it is greater than the average rate of intake from handling <span class="txt-italic">and</span> searching for items already in the diet. This will serve to maximize its overall rate of energy intake. This optimal diet width model, then, leads to a number of predictions. </p>
<ol class="order-list" epub:type="list" id="c07-list-0006">
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">Predators with handling times that are typically short compared to their search times should be generalists (that is, have broad diets), because in the short time it takes them to handle a prey item that has already been found, they can barely begin to search for another prey item. This prediction seems to be supported by the broad diets of many insectivorous birds feeding in trees and shrubs. Searching is always moderately time-consuming, but handling the minute, stationary insects takes negligible time and is almost always successful. A bird, therefore, has something to gain and virtually nothing to lose by consuming an item once found, and overall profitability is maximized by a broad diet.</p>

</li>
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">By contrast, predators with handling times that are long relative to their search times should be specialists: maximizing the rate of energy intake is achieved by including only the most profitable items in the diet. For instance, lions live much of the time in sight of their prey, so that search time is negligible; handling time, on the other hand, and particularly pursuit time, can be long (and very energy-consuming). Lions consequently specialize on those prey that can be pursued most profitably: the immature, the lame, and the old.</p></li>
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">Other things being equal, a predator should have a broader diet in an unproductive environment (where prey items are relatively rare and search times relatively large) than in a productive environment (where search times are generally smaller). This prediction is supported by a study of brown and black bears (<span class="txt-italic">Ursos arctos</span> and <span class="txt-italic">U. americanus</span>) feeding on salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska (<span id="widget-62732" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62732" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62732"></div>). When salmon availability was high, bears consumed less biomass per captured fish, targeting energy-rich fish (those that had not spawned) or energy-rich body parts (eggs in females, brain in males). That is, their diet became more specialized when prey were more abundant.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Overall, then, we can see how an evolutionary, optimal foraging approach can help us make sense of predators’ foraging behavior. The approach makes predictions of what that behavior might be expected to be, and there is good evidence from real examples to support these predictions.</p>

<h1 class="level-1 enum-head txt-orange"><span class="enum">7.5</span> Population Dynamics of Predation</h1>
<p class="para">What roles do predators play in driving the dynamics of their prey, or prey play in driving the dynamics of their predators? Are there common patterns of dynamics that emerge? The preceding sections should have made it plain that there are no simple answers to these questions. It depends on details of the behavior of individual predators and prey, on possible compensatory responses at individual and population levels, and so on. We can build an understanding of these complex dynamics, however, by starting simply and then adding additional features one by one to construct a more realistic picture.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c07-sec-0011">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Underlying dynamics of predator–prey interactions: a tendency to cycle</h2>
<p class="para">We begin by consciously oversimplifying—ignoring everything but the predator and the prey, and asking what underlying tendency there might be in the dynamics of their interaction. It turns out that the underlying tendency is to exhibit coupled oscillations—cycles—in abundance. With this established, we can turn to the many other important factors that might modify or override this underlying tendency. Rather than explore each and every one of them, however, we examine just two of the more important ones: crowding and spatial patchiness. These two factors cannot, of course, tell the whole story; but they illustrate how the differences in predator–prey dynamics, from example to example, might be explained by the varying influences of the different factors with a potential impact on those dynamics.</p>
<p class="para indent">Starting simply then, suppose there is a large population of prey. Predators presented with this population should do well: they should consume many prey and hence increase in abundance themselves. The large population of prey thus gives rise to a large population of predators, albeit after a time delay while the positive effects on the predators’ survival and fecundity take effect. But this increasing population of predators increasingly takes its toll of the prey. The large population of predators therefore gives rise to a small population of prey, though also after a time delay, while predators (literally) eat into the abundance of the prey. Now the predators are in trouble: there are large numbers of them and very little food. Their abundance declines (another time delay as they starve and fail to reproduce). But this takes the pressure off the prey: the small population of predators gives rise to a large population of prey—and the populations are back to where they started. There is, in short, an underlying tendency for predators and their prey to undergo coupled oscillations in abundance—population cycles (see below, <span id="widget-62733" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62733" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.17</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62733"></div>)—essentially because of these time delays in the response of predator abundance to that of the prey, and vice versa. A simple mathematical model—the Lotka–Volterra model—conveying essentially this message is described in <span id="widget-62734" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62734" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 7.1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62734"></div></span>.

The world is much more complex than imagined here. But the model does capture the essential tendency for coupled cycles in predator–prey interactions.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Alfred James Lotka was born in 1880 to American parents in what is now Lviv in Ukraine. After an education in physics and chemistry that took him to England and Germany, he got employment as an assistant chemist with the General Chemical Company in New York in 1902. He took a year out getting a master’s degree in physics from Cornell University in 1909, but most of the years until the early 1920s saw him not in any academic establishment, but commercially employed as either a physicist or chemist. His passion, however, was the application of the principles of physics to questions in biology, and he published a series of articles on this, more or less as an enthusiastic amateur, in scientific journals. These came to the attention of Raymond Pearl in Baltimore (see <span id="widget-62751" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62751" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 6.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62751"></div>) who by 1922 managed to get Lotka appointed to a modest Fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. There, free to indulge his passion, Lotka drew the threads of his work together and published <span class="txt-italic">Elements of Physical Biology</span> in 1925. The central vision of his work was of biological organisms as processors of energy. Touching on an enormous diversity of topics from the nitrogen cycle to the function of consciousness, the book included what we now consider his most famous equations as only a very small part, receiving no special emphasis.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Vito Volterra was born in 1860 in Ancona, Italy, and though his parents were poor, he had risen by 1883 to become a professor in mathematical physics at The University of Pisa, and then, via Turin, at the University of Rome from 1900. Years of work on elasticity, the theory of integro-differential equations and the like were diverted onto quite another track in 1925, when the fiancée of his ecologist daughter, Umberto D’Ancona, interested him in a set of data from the fisheries of the Adriatic Sea, where the virtual suspension of fishing around the time of the First World War had led to a marked increase in the numbers of predatory fish species. The following year he published an extended initial analysis in Italian of the dynamics of interacting species, and a much abbreviated English version in the journal <span class="txt-italic">Nature</span>. His focus was not so much on energy as on evolution: species interactions as part of the more general struggle for existence.</p>

<p class="para indent">When Lotka read the article in 1926, his response appears to have been an understandable combination of pride that such an eminent and established mathematician was traveling on so similar a path to his own (albeit with a rather different emphasis) and concern that he would be denied the credit that he deserved. Volterra in his turn seems to have been perfectly happy to concede priority but at pains to point up important differences. Nonetheless, there followed a number of years during which Volterra was much more fully engaged with his new biological project than Lotka, who had become a demographer working for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York, such that Lotka’s contribution was often (far too often for Lotka’s liking) relegated to footnotes in much longer descriptions of Volterra’s work. Neither, though, seems positively to have sought preeminence, and by the late 1930s it had become common practice, as it has been ever since, to join their names together when referring to the models.</p>

<p class="para">the ‘expectation’ of cycles is only rarely fulfilled</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">The underlying tendency for predator– prey interactions to generate coupled oscillations in abundance could lead us to expect such cycles in real populations, but many aspects of predator and prey ecology had to be ignored in order to demonstrate it, and these omissions can greatly modify expectations. It is no surprise, then, that there are few good examples of clear predator–prey cycles—though they have received a great deal of attention from ecologists. Nonetheless, as we try to make sense of predator–prey population dynamics, the underlying tendency to cycle is a good place to start.</p>
<p class="para indent">They do occur sometimes. It has been possible in several cases, for example, to generate coupled predator–prey oscillations, several generations in length, in the laboratory (<span id="widget-62752" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62752" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.17a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62752"></div>; see also <span id="widget-62753" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62753" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.21c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62753"></div></span>). Among field populations, there are a number of examples in which regular cycles of prey and predator abundance can be discerned. Cycles in hare populations, in particular, have been discussed by ecologists since the 1920s, and were recognized by fur trappers more than 100 years earlier. Most famous of all is the snowshoe hare, <span class="txt-italic">Lepus americanus</span>, which in the boreal forests of North America follows a 10-year cycle (although in reality this varies in length between 8 and 11 years; see <span id="widget-62754" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62754" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.17b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62754"></div></span>). The snowshoe hare is the dominant herbivore of the region, feeding on the terminal twigs of numerous shrubs and small trees. A number of predators, including the Canada lynx (<span class="txt-italic">Lynx canadensis</span>), have associated cycles of similar length. The hare cycles often involve 10–30-fold changes in abundance, and 100-fold changes can occur in some habitats. They are made all the more spectacular by being virtually synchronous over a vast area from Alaska to Newfoundland.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">But are the hare and lynx participants in a predator–prey cycle? This immediately seems less likely once we note the number of other species with which both interact. Their food web (see <span class="link">Section 9.5</span>) is shown in <span id="widget-62755" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62755" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.18</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62755"></div>. In fact, both experimental studies (Krebs et al., 2001<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0330">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0330</a>-->) and statistical analyses of the population dynamics data (Stenseth et al., 1997<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0555">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0555</a>-->) suggest that whereas the dynamics of the hares are driven by their interactions with both their food and their predators (especially lynx), the dynamics of the lynx are driven largely by their interaction with their hare prey, much as the food web might suggest. Both the hare–plant and the predator–hare interactions have some propensity to cycle on their own—but, in practice, the cycle seems normally to be generated by the interaction between the two. This warns us that even when we have a predator–prey pair both exhibiting cycles, we may still not be observing simple predator–prey oscillations.<p></p>

<p class="para">Large outbreaks of forest tent caterpillars occur about every 10 years, and each lasts for 2–4 years. During these outbreaks, massive damage is done to the foliage of forest trees over large tracks of land.

<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Caterpillars Making a Meal Out of Northern Forests</h6>
<p class="para">Forest tent caterpillars have munched their way through much of northern Wisconsin, eating aspen, sugar maple, birch and oak from Tomahawk to southern Canada.</p>
<p class="para indent">The insects move across roads in waves that make the pavement seem to crawl and hang from trees in large clumps.… ‘One lady from Eagle River said they were on her house and on her driveway and on her sidewalk, and she was ready to move back to Oak Creek’, said Jim Bishop, public affairs manager for the Department of Natural Resource’s northern region.</p>
<p class="para indent">Shane Weber, a DNR forest entomologist from Spooner, said the caterpillars on sidewalks, driveways and highways are a good sign. ‘Whenever they start these mass overland moves, suddenly moving in waves across the ground, it means that they’re starving, looking for another source of food’, he said.</p>
<p class="para indent">In Superior, customers have inundated Dan’s Feed Bin [general store], looking for ways to rid their yards and homes of the insects. Employee Amy Connor said some customers held their telephones up to the window so Connor could hear the worms falling like hail. ‘It’s terribly gross’, she said.</p>
<p class="para indent">The caterpillars have eaten most of the leaves in the Upper Peninsula, said Jeff Forslund, of Hartland, who drove to Ramsey, Michigan. ‘My grandfather has about 500 acres of aspen, and there isn’t a leaf left’, Forslund said.</p>
<p class="para indent">Most of the trees will survive and the caterpillars should start spinning cocoons by mid-June, the DNR said. Forest entomologist Dave Hall said he expects the outbreak to peak this year. ‘I can’t imagine it getting much worse’, he said. The last infestation of the native forest tent caterpillars in Wisconsin was in the late 1980s and early 1990s.… During the last tent caterpillar outbreak, several serious traffic collisions in Canada were blamed on slick roads from squashed tent caterpillars.</p>
<p class="para indent">About 4 million of the fuzzy crawlers can be found per acre at the peak of the cyclical infestation, the DNR said.</p>

For example, measles has been calculated to have a threshold population size of around 300,000 individuals and is unlikely to have been of great importance until quite recently in human biology. However, it has generated major epidemics in the growing cities of the industrialized world in the 18th and 19th centuries, and in the growing concentrations of population in the developing world in the 20th century. Current estimates suggest that there were around 750,000 deaths each year from measles infection in the developing world in 2000, but control programs (mainly immunization) had reduced numbers to around 150,000 per year by the end of that decade (Dabbagh et al., 2009).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Moreover, the immunity induced by many bacterial and viral infections, combined with death from the infection, reduces the number of susceptible hosts in a population, reduces <span class="equation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-94-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-273-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;0&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-273"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math></script></span></span><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-94-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr></nobr></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-94"><m:math display="inline"><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>R</m:mi><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:msub></m:mrow></m:math></script></span>, and therefore tends to lead to a decline in the incidence of the disease itself.

We are once again looking at a marked tendency to cycle. Such diseases tend to generate a sequence from high incidence, to few susceptibles, to low incidence, to many susceptibles, to high incidence, etc. This undoubtedly underlies the observed cyclic incidence of many human diseases (especially prior to modern immunization programs), with the differing lengths of cycle reflecting the differing characteristics of the diseases: measles with peaks every 2 years, approximately, pertussis (whooping cough) every 3–4 years, diphtheria every 4–6 years, and so on (<span id="widget-62760" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62760" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.19</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62760"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para">mutual interference among predators reduces the predation rate</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">One fundamental feature that we have ignored so far is the fact that no predator lives in isolation: all are affected by other predators. The most obvious effects are competitive. When predator numbers are high, there may be less food than the predators overall require, and individual predators will suffer as a consequence (see <span id="widget-62761" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62761" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62761"></div>). However, even when food is not limited, the consumption rate per individual can be reduced with increases in predator density by a number of processes known collectively as <span class="txt-italic">mutual interference</span>. For example, many predators interact behaviorally with other members of their population, leaving less time for feeding. Hummingbirds actively and aggressively defend rich sources of nectar; parasitoid wasps will threaten and, if need be, fiercely drive away an intruder from their own area of tree trunk. Alternatively, an increase in consumer density may lead to an increased rate of emigration, or of consumers stealing food from one another (as do many gulls), or the prey themselves may respond to the presence of consumers and become less available for capture.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In all such cases, the underlying pattern is the same: the consumption rate per individual predator declines with increasing predator density. This reduction is itself likely to have an adverse effect on the fecundity, growth, and mortality of individual predators, which intensifies as predator density increases. The predator population is thus subject to density-dependent regulation (see <span id="widget-62762" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62762" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapters 3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62762"></div> and <span id="widget-62763" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62763" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62763"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para">competition or the immune response in parasites?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">With parasites, too, it is to be expected that individuals will often interfere with each other’s activities. There may, in the first place, be intraspecific competition between parasites for host resources and density dependence in their growth, birth, and/or death rates. However, for vertebrate hosts at least, the intensity of the immune reaction elicited from a host also typically depends on the abundance of parasites. A rare attempt to disentangle these two effects utilized the availability of mutant rats lacking an effective immune response (<span id="widget-62764" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62764" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.20</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62764"></div>). Both these and normal rats were subjected to experimental infection with a nematode, <span class="txt-italic">Strongyloides ratti</span>, at a range of doses. Any reduction in parasite fitness with dose in the normal rats could be due to either intraspecific competition or an immune response increasing with dose (or both). But clearly, in the mutant rats only the first of these is possible. In fact, there was no observable response in the mutant rats (<span id="widget-62765" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62765" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.20</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62765"></div></span>), indicating that at these doses, which were themselves similar to those observed naturally, there was no evidence of intraspecific competition. Hence, the pattern observed in the normal rats is entirely the result of a density-dependent immune response. Of course, this does not mean that there is never intraspecific competition among parasites within hosts, but it does emphasize the particular subtleties that arise when an organism’s habitat is its reactive host.<p></p>

<p class="para">crowding tends to dampen or eliminate predator–prey cycles</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Prey, too, are likely to suffer reductions in growth, birth, and survival rates as their abundance increases and their individual intake of resources declines; and the effect of either predator or prey crowding on their dynamics is, in a general sense, fairly easy to predict. Prey crowding prevents their abundance from reaching as high a level as it would otherwise do, which means in turn that predator abundance is also unlikely to reach the same peaks. Predator crowding, similarly, prevents predator abundance from rising so high, but it also tends therefore to prevent them from reducing prey abundance as much as they would otherwise do. Overall, therefore, crowding is likely to have a damping effect on any predator–prey cycles, reducing their amplitude or removing them altogether. This occurs not only because crowding chops off the peaks and troughs, but also because each peak in a cycle tends itself to generate the next trough (e.g., high prey abundance → high predator abundance → <span class="txt-italic">low</span> prey abundance), so that the lowering of peaks in itself tends to raise troughs.</p>
<p class="para indent">There are certainly examples that appear to confirm the stabilizing effects of crowding in predator–prey interactions. For instance, there are two groups of primarily herbivorous rodents that are widespread in the Arctic: the microtine rodents (lemmings and voles) and the ground squirrels. The microtines are renowned for their dramatic, cyclic fluctuations in abundance, but the ground squirrels have populations that remain remarkably constant from year to year, especially in open meadow and tundra habitats. There, significantly, they appear to be strongly self-limited by food availability, suitable burrowing habitat and their own spacing behavior (Karels &amp; Boonstra, 2000<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0309">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0309</a>-->).</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Predators and prey in patches</h2>
<p class="para">The second feature that was ignored initially but will be examined here is the fact that many populations of predators and prey exist not as a single, homogeneous mass, but as a <span class="txt-bold">metapopulation</span>. The term is used when the overall population is divided, by the patchiness of the environment, into a series of subpopulations, each with its own internal dynamics but linked to other subpopulations by movement (dispersal) between patches (a topic developed further in <span id="widget-62766" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62766" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 9.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62766"></div>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">We get a good idea of the general effect of this spatial structure on predator–prey dynamics by considering the simplest imaginable metapopulation: one consisting of just two subpopulations. If the patches are displaying the same dynamics, and dispersal is the same in both directions, then the dynamics are unaffected: every ‘lost’ individual is counteracted by an equivalent gain. To put it simply, patchiness and dispersal have no effect in their own right. Differences between the patches, however, either in the dynamics within subpopulations or in the dispersal between them, tend, in themselves, to stabilize the interaction: to dampen any cycles that might exist. The reason is that any difference leads to asynchrony in the fluctuations in the patches, meaning that a population at the peak of its cycle tends to lose more by dispersal than it gains, whereas a population at a trough gains more than it loses. Also, even with just two patches, if one subpopulation goes extinct, the other (asynchronous) subpopulation is unlikely to do so at the same time. Dispersers from it may therefore ‘rescue’ the first, allowing the population as a whole, the metapopulation, to persist. Dispersal and asynchrony together, therefore—and some degree of asynchrony is likely to be the general rule—tend to dampen fluctuations in predator–prey dynamics and make population persistence more likely.</p>
<p class="para indent">Is it possible, though, to see the stabilizing influence of this type of metapopulation structure in practice? One example is provided by experimental work on a laboratory system in which a predatory mite <span class="txt-italic">Phytoseiulus persimilis</span> fed on a phyophagous mite, its prey, <span class="txt-italic">Tetranychus urticae</span>. This latter fed on small bean plants collected together on styrofoam ‘islands’ separated by water, but with bridges connecting them across which the mites could walk: either a single large island containing 90 bean plants, or eight smaller islands each containing 10 plants (<span id="widget-62767" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62767" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.21a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62767"></div>). Islands were thus connected, but their dynamics were at least semi-independent since the rate of transfer of mites between islands was low. When all the bean plants were collected together on a single island, the abundance of the prey mite increased, followed, after a delay, by a corresponding rise in the numbers of predators, which then led to a crash in the prey population, followed by a crash of the predators (<span id="widget-62768" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62768" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.21b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62768"></div></span>). There was therefore only a single ‘cycle’ of predator and prey abundance, with the whole system lasting for just 120 days. The underlying predator–prey dynamics were unstable.<p></p>

</figure></aside>
<p class="para indent">When the habitat was broken into eight small islands, however, in two separate runs of the system, both predator and prey persisted for more than a year—indeed until the experiments were terminated. In one case, there was clear evidence of persistent cycles in both predator and prey; in the other, the dynamics were much more erratic but still persistent (<span id="widget-62769" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62769" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.21c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62769"></div>). Notably, though, on the individual small islands, there was not one example of the predator and prey populations persisting. Each went extinct at least once, requiring colonizing mites walking over from an occupied island to rescue that particular population. Predators and prey were therefore ultimately doomed to extinction in each patch (island)—that is, the patch dynamics were unstable. But overall, at any one time, there was a mosaic of unoccupied patches, prey–predator patches heading for extinction, and thriving prey patches; and this mosaic was capable of maintaining persistent populations of both predators and prey, providing stability to the metapopulation as a whole (<span id="widget-62770" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62770" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.21c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62770"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">A similar example, from a natural population, is provided by work off the coast of southern California on the predation by starfish of clumps of mussels (Murdoch &amp; Stewart-Oaten, 1975<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0420">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0420</a>-->). Clumps that are heavily preyed upon are liable to be dislodged by heavy seas so that the mussels die; the starfish are continually driving patches of their mussel prey to extinction. The mussels, however, have planktonic larvae that colonize new locations and initiate new clumps, whereas the starfish disperse much less readily. Thus, patches of mussels are continually becoming extinct, but other clumps are growing prior to the arrival of the starfish. As with the mites, patchiness, and a lack of synchrony between the behavior of different patches, appear capable of stabilizing the dynamics of a predator–prey interaction.</p>
<p class="para indent">Others, too, have demonstrated the power of a metapopulation structure in promoting the persistence of coupled predator and prey populations when their dynamics in individual subpopulations are unstable. <span id="widget-62771" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62771" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.22a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62771"></div>, for example, shows this for a parasitoid attacking its beetle host. <span id="widget-62772" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62772" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.22b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62772"></div></span> shows similar results for prey and predatory ciliates (protists), where, in support of the role of a metapopulation structure, it was also possible to demonstrate the asynchrony in the dynamics of individual subpopulations and frequent local prey extinctions and recolonizations (Holyoak &amp; Lawler, 1996<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0252">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0252</a>-->).<p></p>

<p class="para">predation as an interrupter of competitive exclusion: predator-mediated coexistence</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">What roles can predation play when we broaden our perspective from populations to whole ecological communities? Central to this is the notion that predation is just one of the forces acting on communities that can be described as a ‘disturbance.’ For example, in terms of its effect, a predator opening up a gap in a community for colonization by other organisms is often indistinguishable from the battering of waves on a rocky shore or a hurricane in a forest.</p>
<p class="para indent">In fact, many of the effects of predation on community structure (and of other disturbances) are the result of its interaction with competitive exclusion (taking up a theme introduced in <span id="widget-62773" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62773" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 6.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62773"></div>). In an undisturbed world, the most competitive species might be expected to drive less competitive species to extinction. However, this assumes that the organisms are actually competing. Yet there are many situations where predation may hold down the densities of competitors, so that resources are not limiting and individuals do not compete for them. When predation promotes the coexistence of species that might otherwise exclude one another, this is known as <span class="txt-bold">predator-mediated coexistence</span>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">For example, in a study of nine Scandinavian islands, pigmy owls (<span class="txt-italic">Glaucidium passerinum</span>) occurred on only four of the islands, and the pattern of occurrence of three species of tit had a striking relationship with this distribution. The five islands without the predatory owl were home to only one species, the coal tit (<span class="txt-italic">Parus ater</span>). However, in the presence of the owl, the coal tit was always joined by two larger tit species, the willow tit (<span class="txt-italic">P. montanus</span>) and the crested tit (<span class="txt-italic">P. cristatus</span>). Kullberg and Ekman (2000<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0333">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0333</a>-->) argue that the coal tit is the superior competitor for food; but the two larger species are less affected than the coal tit by predation from the owl. It seems that the owl is responsible for predator-mediated coexistence, by reducing the competitive dominance enjoyed by coat tits in its absence.</p>

<p class="para">selective predation on a rocky shore</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">This suggests that broadly, <span class="txt-italic">selective</span> predation should favor an increase in species numbers in a community as long as the preferred prey are competitively dominant. This is supported by a study that took place along the rocky shores of New England, where the most abundant and important herbivore in mid and low intertidal zones is the periwinkle snail <span class="txt-italic">Littorina littorea</span>. The snail will feed on a wide range of algal (seaweed) species but is relatively selective: it shows a strong preference for small, tender species and in particular for the green alga <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha intestinalis</span>. The least-preferred foods are much tougher (for example, the perennial red alga <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus crispus</span> and brown algae).</p>
<p class="para indent"><span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span>, the snails’ preferred food, is a competitive dominant in their absence. If snails are artificially removed from a rock pool dominated by <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus</span>, <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> and several other algae settle, grow, and become abundant, and <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> ultimately dominates; whereas naturally, snails feed on the young stages of many ephemeral algae, including <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span>. Conversely, <span class="txt-italic">adding</span> snails to <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> pools leads, in a year, to a decline in the percentage cover of <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> from almost 100% to less than 5%. Clearly, snails are responsible for the dominance of <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus</span> in <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus</span> pools.</p>
<p class="para indent">The natural composition of rock pools varies from almost pure stands of <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> to almost pure stands of <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus</span>, and it seems that grazing by these periwinkle snails is responsible (<span id="widget-62776" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62776" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.24a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62776"></div>). When periwinkles were absent or rare, <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> appeared to competitively exclude other species and the number of algal species was low. At very high densities of periwinkles, all palatable algal species were consumed to extinction, leaving almost pure stands of <span class="txt-italic">Chondrus</span>. Again, therefore, it was at intermediate predation intensities that the abundance of the preferred <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> (and other ephemeral algal species) was reduced, competitive exclusion was prevented, and many species, both palatable and unpalatable, coexisted.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The picture is quite different, though, when the preferred prey species is not competitively dominant. Here, increased predation pressure should simply reduce the number of prey species in the community. This can also be illustrated on the rocky shores of New England, where <span class="txt-italic">Enteromorpha</span> loses its competitive dominance when it interacts with other plants on emergent substrata rather than in tide pools.

<p class="para">A predator may be defined as any organism that consumes all or part of another living organism (its ‘prey’ or ‘host’) thereby benefiting itself, but, under at least some circumstances, reducing the growth, fecundity, or survival of the prey. ‘True’ predators invariably kill their prey and do so more or less immediately after attacking them, and consume several or many prey items in the course of their life. Grazers also attack several or many prey items in the course of their life but consume only part of each prey item and do not usually kill their prey. Parasites also consume only part of each host and also do not usually kill their host, especially in the short term, but attack one or very few hosts in the course of their life.</p>

<p class="para">The fundamental similarity between true predators, grazers, and parasites is that each reduces either the fecundity or the chances of survival of individual prey and may therefore reduce prey abundance. The effects of true predators on the survival of individual prey are obvious. But the effects of grazers and parasites can be equally profound, if more subtle. It is not so straightforward to demonstrate that reductions in the survival or fecundity of individual prey translate into reductions in prey abundance. All sorts of predators can cause reductions in the abundance of their prey, but they do not <span class="txt-italic">necessarily</span> do so.</p>

<p class="para">Grazers and parasites, in particular, often exert their harm not by killing their prey immediately like true predators, but by making the prey more vulnerable to some other form of mortality. The effects of grazers and parasites on the organisms they attack are often <span class="txt-italic">less</span> profound than they first seem because individual plants or host can compensate for these attacks. The effects of predation on a population of prey are complex to predict, because the surviving prey may experience reduced competition for a limiting resource, or produce more offspring, or other predators may take fewer of the prey.</p>

<p class="para">Many predators and grazers typically forage, moving around within their habitat in search of their prey. Other predators sit and wait for their prey, though almost always in a selected location. With parasites and pathogens there may be direct transmission between infectious and uninfected hosts, or contact between free-living stages of the parasite and uninfected hosts may be important. Optimal foraging theory can help us make sense of where predators forage and how long they spend in particular patches of habitat.</p>

<p class="para">There is an underlying tendency for predators and prey to exhibit cycles in abundance, and cycles are observed in some predator–prey and host–parasite interactions. However, there are many important factors that can modify or override the tendency to cycle. Crowding of either predator or prey is likely to have a damping effect on any predator–prey cycles. Many populations of predators and prey exist as a metapopulation. In theory, and in practice, asynchrony in population dynamics in different patches and the process of dispersal tend to dampen any underlying population cycles.</p>

<p class="para">When predation promotes the coexistence of species among which there would otherwise be competitive exclusion, this is known as ‘predator-mediated coexistence.’ The effects of predation generally on a group of competing species depend on which species suffers most. If it is a subordinate species, then this may be driven to extinction and the total number of species in the community will decline. If it is the competitive dominants that suffer most, however, the results of heavy predation will usually be to free space and resources for other species, and species numbers may then increase. It is not unusual for the number of species in a community to be greatest at intermediate levels of predation.</p>

There are many areas in ecology where evolutionary adaptation by natural selection takes center stage to the extent that the term ‘evolutionary ecology’ is often used to describe them.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In several earlier chapters, therefore, we dealt with topics in evolutionary ecology as integral parts of broader ecological questions. Of course, this has not been an exhaustive survey of topics in evolutionary ecology. In the present chapter, therefore, we deal with a number of others, though the final list will still be far from exhaustive. We focus especially on pairs of species that act as reciprocal driving forces in one another’s evolution. In particular, in <span id="widget-62786" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62786" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 8.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62786"></div>, we take up the coevolutionary relationship between predators and their prey, with a particular emphasis on insect–plant and host–pathogen interactions. Here, each adaptation in the prey that fends off or avoids the attacks of a predator provokes a corresponding adaptation in the predator that improves its ability to overcome those defenses, which in turn provokes a response from the prey, and so on.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Our ability to measure levels of relatedness depends on the resolution with which we can differentiate individuals from one another and even determine where they came from or who their parents were. In the past, this was difficult and frequently impossible: reliance on simple, visual markers meant that all individuals within a species often looked the same, and even members of closely related species could often only be distinguished by experienced taxonomists looking down a microscope at, say, details of a male’s genitalia. Now, molecular genetic markers—though they still require experts, and equipment that is expensive (though getting cheaper all the time)—have massively increased the resolution at which we can differentiate between populations and even between individuals, and hence, they have vastly improved our ability to address these types of questions. We begin, therefore, in <span id="widget-62792" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62792" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 8.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62792"></div>, with a short survey of some of the most important of these molecular markers and their uses, so readers wanting a brief explanation of some of the terms mentioned in the main text have somewhere convenient to turn.<p></p>

<div class="box">
<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">Molecular Markers</h5>
<p class="para">This is not the place for crash courses in either molecular biology or the laboratory methods used to extract and analyze molecular markers, but it will nonetheless be useful to have some appreciation of their nature and key properties.</p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Choosing a Molecular Marker</h6>
<p class="para">The basis for all uses of molecular markers in ecology is that we can differentiate one individual from another because of molecular variation among them. Most recent studies (certainly of animals and plants) have used DNA of one type or other for molecular identification. Each portion of the DNA molecule is characterized by the sequence of nucleotide bases of which it is composed—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).</p>
<p class="para indent">The ultimate source of this variation is mutation in the sequence of bases. What happens to the mutation, and the mutated organism, then depends on the balance between natural selection and <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c08-tdef-0003" title="random changes in gene frequency within a population resulting from sampling effects rather than natural selection, and hence of greatest importance in small populations" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - genetic drift">genetic drift</span>, which is random, undirected changes in gene frequency from generation to generation. If the mutation occurs in a region of DNA that is important because, say, it codes for a crucial part of an essential enzyme, then selection is likely to determine the outcome. An unfavorable mutation (the vast majority in important regions of DNA) will quickly be lost, because the mutated organism is less fit than its counterparts. Individuals will therefore differ relatively little in such regions. If there <span class="txt-italic">is</span> differentiation in such a region, it is most likely to reflect <span class="txt-bold">adaptive variation</span>, which occurs when different variants are favored by natural selection in different individuals, perhaps because of where they live.</p>
<p class="para indent">But there are also regions of DNA that appear not to code for important parts of enzymes or to perform any other function. Here the precise sequence is far less crucial. Variation in these regions is therefore said to be ‘neutral,’ and mutations can accumulate there over time. Imagine two offspring of a single mating. They will be genetically very similar. But imagine now that each migrates to a different location and starts a lineage of offspring generations there. As each generation passes, in those regions of their genome where variation is neutral, the lineages will become increasingly divergent as mutations accumulate. A snapshot taken in the future should therefore allow us to determine how long the period of divergence has been: how long ago it was that the two groups shared a common ancestor.</p>
<p class="para indent">However, our ability to do this will depend on the rate of mutation in the DNA region concerned, and indeed, mutation rates in different regions do differ. If the rates are too slow, individuals will tend all to look the same. But if they are too fast, each individual will tend to be so unique that its relationships to others will be hard to discern. Molecular markers should therefore be chosen such that the mutation rate matches the question being addressed, as we see below.</p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Polymerase Chain Reaction (<span class="fc">PCR</span>)</h6>
<p class="para">As a practical point, most studies in molecular ecology, having extracted the DNA from the organism concerned, use the <span class="txt-bold">polymerase chain reaction</span> (PCR). Very simply, PCR requires the identification of informative target regions of DNA and also flanking regions, either side, that can be used to identify the target region. It then uses molecular primers that match the flanking regions, pick up the target region, and repeatedly copy that target region. Thus, an originally small amount of target DNA in the midst of other, unwanted sequences becomes large enough to be subjected to analysis. Being able to make use of small samples, this technique has revolutionized our ability to sample individuals noninvasively, using small amounts of blood, hair, feces, wing clips, and so on.</p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Nuclear and Mitochondrial <span class="fc">DNA</span></h6>
<p class="para">Nuclear DNA is usually inherited equally from both parents and codes for most of an organism’s functions, but in the past especially, many studies have instead used the relatively small lengths of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) found in the mitochondria of each cell. A major advantage of mtDNA is that lineages can be more clearly traced from generation to generation, because it is almost always inherited only from the mother, who contributes the cytoplasm to the fused egg, and it is not subject to the recombination of genetic material during the process of meiosis. Also, the mutation rate is higher than for coding regions of nuclear DNA, allowing finer resolution differentiation. On the other hand, mtDNA offers only a small number of targets, and its maternal inheritance makes it worthless for following matings since offspring can only be linked to their mothers. Increasingly, therefore, studies focus on regions of nuclear DNA, though often in parallel with analyses of mtDNA genes, combining the advantages of both.</p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Microsatellites</h6>
<p class="para">Within the nuclear genome, sequences coding for proteins (genes) are by no means the only regions molecular biologists have used. <span class="txt-bold">Microsatellites</span>, for example, are regions of DNA in which the same two, three, or four bases are repeated many times (<span id="widget-62793" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62793" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.2a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62793"></div>). The variability among individuals, which may be considerable within a population, comes from the precise number of repeats, and we can differentiate the resulting lengths of microsatellite DNA by the speed at which they move through a semisolid medium (a gel) under the influence of an electric current, in electrophoresis. Thus, an appropriately chosen panel of microsatellites for a species may effectively allow each individual in a population to be uniquely identified via a DNA fingerprint, making microsatellites especially appropriate at the finer scales of differentiation.<p></p>

<span class="figure-title">Figure 8.2</span>
<span class="figure-caption block">The term ‘locus’ refers to the location of a region in the overall DNA sequence. The term ‘allele’ refers to a particular variant of the sequence at a particular locus. In animals and plants, that sequence is of two paired strands of DNA. Between the two strands, the bases guanine (G), cytosine (C), adenine (A), and thymine (T) are themselves always paired: G with C, and A with T. (a) Two contrasting alleles at a microsatellite locus. As a microsatellite, its sequence is one of repeated bases, but the lengths of the repeats differ in the two alleles (red), whereas the flanking regions at either end (black) are exactly the same. (b) Here, by contrast, the base sequences are from just one of the DNA strands of a hypothetical gene (a sequence of DNA coding for a protein) from five different individuals, each with a different allele. Differentiation between individuals clearly depends on the variable region towards the center.</span>

<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue">Sequencing</h6>
<p class="para">As far as nuclear or mitochondrial genes are concerned, having chosen, extracted, and amplified the target region from a sample of individuals, we must have some basis for differentiating individuals from one another, determining who is most similar to whom, and so on. Increasingly, the whole sequences of genes are being determined. Initially, the method of gene sequencing developed in the 1970s (and often referred to as Sanger sequencing after its inventor, Nobel Prize winner Frederick Sanger) was carried out manually and thus was slow. This method later gave way to faster, automated methods, but these in their turn are now being replaced by a range of alternative sequencing methods collectively known as <span class="txt-bold">next-generation sequencing</span>. The speed and lower costs of these methods are making the sequencing not just of genes but of whole genomes increasingly possible.</p>
<p class="para indent">We have seen that regions of the same gene differ in terms of their functional importance (<span id="widget-62794" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62794" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.2b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62794"></div>). Some regions are conserved from individual to individual, from population to population, and often from species to species. These are (or are presumed to be) the regions of greatest functional importance, and they play effectively no part in differentiation. But there are other regions where far more variation is observed, and that we presume, therefore, to be neutral or at least subject to weaker selective constraints. It is on the basis of this variation that individuals and populations can be differentiated.<p></p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue"><span class="fc">SNP</span>s</h6>
<p class="para">With the wider availability of gene sequencing, differentiation based on <span class="txt-bold">single nucleotide polymorphisms</span> or SNPs (pronounced ‘snips’) is increasingly possible. A <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c08-tdef-0004" title="the existence within a species or population of different forms of individuals, beyond those that are the result simply of recurrent mutation" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - polymorphism">polymorphism</span> is the occurrence together within a single population of two or more genetically distinct forms or <span class="txt-bold">morphs</span>. The melanic and typical forms of the peppered moth, described in <span id="widget-62795" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62795" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 2.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62795"></div>, are a good example. A SNP is then simply the occurrence together of individuals differing from one another at a single base pair position in the DNA sequence. A single SNP, of course, can only divide a collection of individuals into a very limited number of groups. But SNPs at a larger number of loci (<span id="widget-62796" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62796" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62796"></div></span>) allow individuals to be grouped together on the basis of varying degrees of relatedness. Some may be identical at the loci examined. The individuals most closely related to this group would be those that differ from them at a single SNP, and so on. A variety of statistical methods exist for creating relatedness trees on this basis, which in turn suggest the paths by which their gene sequences have diverged in the past over evolutionary time.<p></p>
<h6 class="level-6 txt-blue"><span class="fc">DNA</span> Barcoding</h6>
<p class="para">In cases where we know how much differentiation there is within and between a group of species, we may wish to use that information in order to rapidly and efficiently determine the species identity of any newly acquired samples. DNA or genetic barcoding is an approach to doing this, based on one or just a few DNA sequences. It relies on there being a ‘barcoding gap,’ such that interspecific divergences are clearly greater than divergences between individuals within a species.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Differentiation within species: albatrosses</h2>
<p class="para">Albatrosses are wide-ranging sea birds with the largest wingspans of any birds alive today. Sadly, though, of the 21 species normally recognized, 19 are regarded as threatened with extinction and the other two as near threatened. Taxonomists have recently split the black-browed albatross into two species: <span class="txt-italic">Thalassarche impavida</span>, found only on Campbell Island, between New Zealand and Antarctica, and <span class="txt-italic">T. melanophris</span>, with breeding populations elsewhere in the sub-Antarctic, including the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Chile (<span id="widget-62797" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62797" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.3a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62797"></div>). The similarly sized gray-headed albatross, <span class="txt-italic">T. chrysostoma</span>, also breeds on a number of sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia. The black-browed species usually remain associated with coastal shelf systems, whereas gray-headed albatrosses feed much more often far from land, but both, like all albatross species, are thought to exhibit <span class="txt-bold">natal philopatry</span>; that is, they return very close to their place of birth to breed. Numbers at all sites are declining each year. Hence, the questions arise: How connected or separate are these populations? Should conservation efforts be directed at what we currently perceive to be whole species, or at particular breeding populations?<p></p>

<p class="para indent">These questions were addressed for both species by a study that used both mtDNA sequences and a panel of seven microsatellites (Burg &amp; Croxall, 2001; see <span id="widget-62798" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62798" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 8.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62798"></div>).

Previously, the relative stability of the large Falkland Islands population was taken as insurance against any real vulnerability to extinction of the species generally.

Getting the balance right is not easy. But even with a policy in place, there may still be difficulties in implementing that policy if, somewhere between the sea and the plate, the fish are mislabeled.<p></p>

They also promote the improvement of industry organization by requiring that valid information is transmitted throughout the chain of production. Provided they are adequately enforced, policies governing seafood labeling … should theoretically assist in the monitoring of industry operation, encourage high food-safety standards, help prevent fraud for economic gain, facilitate conservation efforts, and help avoid illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing products from reaching consumers.”</p>

<p class="para indent">Mislabeling was clearly widespread, and as the authors point out: “The levels of mislabeling revealed in this study raise concerns about the functioning of the seafood industry in Europe. The gravity of this problem is amplified if we acknowledge that cod is both a historically and currently popular seafood… The high levels of cod mislabeling found in Ireland could be … creating a false perception of market availability, and leading consumers to believe that because cod is so widely available, the stocks must be healthy.”</p>
<p class="para indent">Perhaps unsurprisingly, they conclude: “The application of tools for the accurate and cost-effective genetic identification of seafood at all stages in the chain of production should be promoted. Here, the mitochondrial DNA barcode region was successfully amplified, through standard protocols … in all samples tested, including many that had been battered, breaded, smoked, deep-fried, and degraded to varying extents. Rapid advances in molecular genetics and bioinformatics will make this, and even more sophisticated methodologies, more available and affordable in the near future.”</p>

<p class="para indent">In the United States as a whole, the red wolf coexists with two other, closely related species, the gray wolf, <span class="txt-italic">C. lupus</span> (once common throughout much of the United States but now confined to the far north and to Canada), and the coyote, <span class="txt-italic">C. latrans</span>, which has expanded its distribution and can now be found in much of the United States. Traditional analyses, based on morphological features, placed the red wolf as a genuine, separate species, intermediate in many ways between the gray wolf and the coyote (Nowak, 1979). However, as we shall see below, molecular markers suggest strongly that the red wolf is a hybrid arising from interbreeding between gray wolves and coyotes.</p>
<p class="para indent">A number of questions therefore suggest themselves (Wayne, 1996), including: Should the conservation status of the red wolf, and the amount of money spent on its conservation, be downgraded if it is acknowledged that it is a hybrid and not a full species? And will attempts to save the red wolf by reintroduction be undermined, in any case, because of the movement of genes from gray wolves or coyotes into the red wolf gene pool as a result of interbreeding? In other words, will ‘red wolf-ness’ be diluted as fast as it is introduced?</p>
<p class="para indent">The red wolf question has been examined in the past using a variety of techniques and DNA sources, including mtDNA and microsatellites in the nuclear DNA (see <span id="widget-62809" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62809" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 8.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62809"></div>). More recently, however, scientists have used the production of commercial SNP arrays (see also <span id="widget-62810" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62810" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 8.1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62810"></div></span>) for genotyping individuals of domesticated species. So in this case, given the high degree of relatedness between dogs and the wolves and coyotes, a Canine SNP Genome Mapping Array was directed towards the question.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Dogs themselves are genetically quite separate from all the nondomesticated species (<span id="widget-62811" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62811" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.5b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62811"></div>); coyotes are also clearly distinct from the wolves; and the wolves of Eurasia are not much less distinct, in their turn, from those of North America. It is also clear, however, that red wolves are much more closely related to coyotes than they are to gray wolves in the United States.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In fact, attribution of the various portions of the red wolf genome to its most likely ancestors (<span id="widget-62812" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62812" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.5c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62812"></div>) indicates that red wolves are the result of interbreeding between coyotes and gray wolves that began around 114 generations (290–430 years) ago, when the southeastern United States was being converted to agriculture, followed by further interbreeding between these and coyotes as the gray wolves retreated northwestwards. Interestingly, interbreeding between coyotes and gray wolves is still going on in the Great Lakes region (<span id="widget-62813" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62813" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.5 a,b,c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62813"></div></span>), giving rise to separate mixed-ancestry populations, though the proportion of gray wolf genes in these is very much higher than for the red wolf.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In answer to our original questions, then, (i) the red wolf seems, ultimately, to be a hybrid rather than a separate species with a more ancient origin (and so arguably less of a priority for conservation), and (ii) if any program of reintroduction has, as a key aim, the avoidance of gene exchange with coyotes, then that goal may need to be reconsidered, since the process appears central to the genetic makeup of red wolves (von Holdt et al., 2011). However, whether biological status and practical difficulties combine to undermine even the desirability of reintroducing red wolves is not simply a scientific question. Public perception and opinion (in this case regarding the conservation importance of the red wolf) must also be taken into account in this and most conservation issues, especially when public funds are involved. A molecular ecology perspective has been immensely informative—but information can sometimes muddy rather than clarify the waters.</p>

<p class="para">We turn now from evolution at the molecular level to evolution at the level of species interactions, starting with those in which species are in opposition to one another. Following some general background, we turn first to interactions between insects and the plants they eat, and then to those between parasites and their hosts.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c08-sec-0016">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Coevolution</h2>
<p class="para">We can link the dynamics of consumer-resource pairs, described in <span id="widget-62814" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62814" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62814"></div>, to the dynamics of whole webs of interacting species, which we will describe in <span id="widget-62815" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62815" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 9</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62815"></div></span>, by noting how specialized or generalized particular consumers are. Generalists draw the species of a community together into large interactive networks. Specialists divide communities into detached or semidetached compartments. Coevolution plays a vital part in determining levels of specialization.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">We saw in <span id="widget-62816" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62816" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62816"></div> that many prey species have evolved defenses that either reduce the chances of an encounter with a consumer or increase the chances of surviving such an encounter. But of course, a better defended prey itself exerts a selection pressure on consumers to overcome that defense. If a consumer evolves features that allow it to do so, it will have stolen a march on its competitors. But diverting its metabolism towards overcoming the prey’s defenses is likely to make it more of a specialist on that prey type—which is then under particular selective pressure to defend itself against that particular consumer, and so on. We can therefore imagine a continuing interaction in which the evolution of both consumer and prey depends crucially on the evolution of the other, as each tends to become increasingly specialized. Ehrlich and Raven (1964) called this a coevolutionary ‘arms race.’ In its most extreme form, a coadapted pair of species is locked together in perpetual struggle.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In fact, what is unacceptable as a food resource to most animals may, as a result of this process, evolve to become the chosen, even unique diet of others. For example, the tropical legume <span class="txt-italic">Dioclea metacarpa</span> is toxic to almost all insect species because it contains a nonprotein amino acid, l-canavanine, which the insects incorporate (lethally) into their proteins in place of arginine. But a species of bruchid beetle, <span class="txt-italic">Caryedes brasiliensis</span>, has evolved a modified enzyme that distinguishes between l-canavanine and arginine, and the larvae of these beetles feed solely on <span class="txt-italic">D. metacarpa</span> (Rosenthal et al., 1982).</p>

<section class="section-2" id="c08-sec-0017">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Insect–plant arms races</h2>

We also saw that these chemicals can be divided into qualitative chemicals that are poisonous, can kill in small doses, and tend to be induced by herbivore attacks, and quantitative chemicals that are digestion-reducing, rely on an accumulation of ill effects, and tend to be produced all the time. These chemicals will select for adaptations in herbivores that can overcome them.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">It seems probable, however, that toxic chemicals, by virtue of their specificity, are likely to be the foundation of an arms race, requiring an equally specific response from a herbivore, whereas chemicals that make plants generally indigestible are much more difficult to overcome through any targeted adaptation (Cornell &amp; Hawkins, 2003). Put simply, plants relying on toxins are more prone to become involved in arms races with their herbivores (like the beetle and legume described above) than those relying on more quantitative chemicals.</p>

<p class="para indent">Is it the case, then, that specialist herbivores, locked in their coevolutionary arms races, tend to perform better when faced with their plants’ toxic chemicals than do generalists? And conversely, do generalists, having invested in overcoming a wide range of chemicals, perform better than specialists when faced with chemicals that have not provoked coevolutionary responses? An analysis of a wide range of data sets for insect herbivores fed on artificial diets with added chemicals suggests that this is indeed the case, in spite of a great deal of variation around these general trends (<span id="widget-62818" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62818" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.6</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62818"></div>).<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Coevolution of parasites and their hosts</h2>
<p class="para">The intimate association between parasites and their hosts makes them especially prone to coevolutionary arms races. Indeed, the specialization may go further than that between species. Within species, it is common to find a high degree of genetic variation in the virulence of parasites and/or in the resistance or immunity of hosts. Every few years, for example, as we are perhaps more aware than ever, a new strain of the influenza virus evolves of sufficient virulence and novelty to generate a widespread epidemic and mortality in human populations that had been relatively resistant to previously circulating strains. No strain has been more devastating—at the time of writing—than the worldwide epidemic (<span class="txt-italic">pandemic</span>) of Spanish flu that followed World War I in 1918/19 and killed 20 million people—many more than died in the war itself.</p>
<p class="para indent">Human diseases can also provide examples of variation in host resistance. When the Native Americans of the Canadian Plains were forcibly settled onto reservations in the 1880s, their death rate due to tuberculosis (TB) initially exploded but then gradually declined (<span id="widget-62825" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62825" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.8</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62825"></div>). Environmental factors (inadequate diet, overcrowding, spiritual demoralization) undoubtedly played some part in these fatalities, but variations in resistance are also likely to have been significant. The mortality rate among the Native Americans was often 20 times that of the surrounding European colonist population, who were living in similar conditions but had already been exposed to TB. Some native families had a particularly low mortality rate in the 1880s epidemic, and many of the survivors in the 1930s were descendants of those families (Ferguson, 1933; Dobson &amp; Carper, 1996).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">It may seem straightforward that parasites in a population select for the evolution of more resistant hosts, which in turn select for more infective parasites: a classic arms race. In fact, the process is not necessarily so straightforward, though there are certainly examples where host and parasite drive one another’s evolution. A most dramatic and classic example involves the rabbit and the myxoma virus, which causes myxomatosis. The virus originated in the South American jungle rabbit <span class="txt-italic">Sylvilagus brasiliensis</span>, where it causes a mild disease that only rarely kills the host.

<p class="para indent">In one of the greatest examples of biological pest control, the myxoma virus was introduced into Australia in the 1950s to control the European rabbit, which had become a pest of grazing lands. The disease spread rapidly in 1950–1951, and rabbit populations were greatly reduced – by more than 90% in some places. At the same time, the virus was introduced to England and France, and there too it resulted in huge reductions in the rabbit populations. The evolutionary changes that then occurred in Australia were followed in detail by Fenner and his associates, who had the brilliant foresight to establish baseline genetic strains of both rabbits and virus (Fenner, 1983). They used these to measure subsequent changes in the virulence of the virus and the resistance of the host as they evolved in the field.</p>
<p class="para indent">When the disease was first introduced to Australia it killed more than 99% of infected rabbits. This case mortality fell to 90% within one year and then declined further. The virulence of virus isolates was graded according to host survival time and the case mortality of control rabbits. The original, highly virulent virus was grade I, which killed &gt; 99% of infected laboratory rabbits. Already by 1952, most of the virus isolates from the field were the less-virulent grades III and IV. At the same time, the rabbit population in the field was increasing in resistance. When injected with a standard grade III strain, field samples of rabbits in 1950–1951 had a case mortality of nearly 90%. This had declined to less than 30% only 8 years later (<span id="widget-62826" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62826" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.9</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62826"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">This evolution of resistance is easy to understand: resistant rabbits are obviously favored by natural selection in the presence of the myxoma virus. The case of the virus, however, is subtler. The contrast between the virulence of the virus in the European rabbit and its lack of virulence in the South American host with which it had coevolved, combined with the attenuation of its virulence in Australia and Europe after its introduction, fit a commonly held view that parasites evolve toward becoming benign to their hosts in order to prevent eliminating their host and thus their habitat. This view, however, is wrong. The parasites favored by natural selection are those with the greatest fitness (broadly, the greatest reproductive rate). Sometimes this is achieved through a decline in virulence, but sometimes it is not. In the myxoma virus, as we next explain, an initial decline in virulence was indeed favored—but further declines were not.</p>
<p class="para indent">The myxoma virus is blood-borne and is transmitted from host to host by blood-feeding insect vectors. In the first 20 years after its introduction to Australia, the main vectors were mosquitoes, which feed only on live hosts. The problem for grade I and II viruses is that they kill the host so quickly that there is only a very short time in which the mosquito can transmit them. Effective transmission may be possible at very high host densities, but as soon as densities decline, so does transmission. Hence, following the initial drop in rabbit densities, there was selection against grades I and II and in favor of less virulent grades, giving rise to longer periods of host infectiousness.</p>
<p class="para indent">At the other end of the virulence scale, however, the mosquitoes are unlikely to transmit grade V of the virus because it produces very few infective particles. Hence the majority were grade III. The situation was complicated in the late 1960s when an alternative vector of the disease, the rabbit flea <span class="txt-italic">Spilopsyllus cuniculi</span> (the main vector in England), was introduced to Australia, apparently favoring more virulent strains than the mosquitoes had done. Overall, however, there has been selection in the rabbit–myxomatosis system not for decreased virulence as such, but for increased transmissibility and hence increased fitness, which happens in this system to be maximized at intermediate grades of virulence.</p>

<p class="para">bacteria and bacteriophage</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In other cases, host–parasite coevolution is more definitely antagonistic; we find increased resistance in the host and increased infectivity in the parasite. A classic example is the interaction between agricultural plants and their pathogens (Burdon, 1987), though in this case the resistant hosts are often introduced by human intervention. There may even be gene-for-gene matching, with a particular virulence allele in the pathogen selecting for a resistant allele in the host, which in turn selects for alleles other than the original allele in the pathogen, and so on. In fact, these detailed processes have often proved difficult to observe, but this has been done with a laboratory system consisting of the bacterium <span class="txt-italic">Pseudomonas fluorescens</span> and its viral parasite, the bacteriophage (or phage) SBW25Φ2, where such evolution is relatively easy to observe because generation times are so short.</p>
<p class="para indent">Changes in both host and parasite were monitored as 18 replicate coexisting populations of bacterium and phage were transferred from culture bottle to culture bottle every two days for 16 transfers (about 120 bacterial generations in all). Crucially, when the proportion of bacteria resistant to the phage was estimated at transfers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, the bacteria were tested not only against their contemporary phage. They were also tested against the phage from two transfers previously, against the original phage (retained for this purpose), and against the phage from two transfers in the future (for which purpose the bacteria were also retained). It is apparent that, as the generations passed, the bacteria became generally more resistant to the phage at the same time as the phage became generally more infective to the bacteria; each was being driven by the directional selection of an arms race (<span id="widget-62827" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62827" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.10</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62827"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para">At least in terms of geographic extent, some of the most dramatic mutualisms are those of human agriculture. The numbers of individual plants of wheat, barley, oats, corn, and rice, and the areas these crops occupy, vastly exceed what they would have been if not for cultivation. The increase in the human population since the time of hunter–gatherers is some measure of the reciprocal advantage to <span class="txt-italic">Homo sapiens</span>. Even without doing the experiment, we can easily imagine the effect the extinction of humans would have on the world population of rice plants, or the effect of the extinction of rice plants on the population of humans.

<p class="para indent">Similar farming mutualisms have developed in termite and especially ant societies, where the insect farmers may protect individuals they exploit from competitors and predators and may even move or tend them. Ants, for example, farm many species of aphids (homopterans) in return for sugar-rich secretions of honeydew. The flocks of aphids benefit through suffering lower mortality rates caused by predators, showing increased feeding and excretion rates, and forming larger colonies.</p>
<p class="para indent">But this is not a cozy relationship with nothing but benefits; the aphids are being manipulated and they may also be paying a price. This cost is apparent from a study of colonies of the aphid <span class="txt-italic">Tuberculatus quercicola</span> attended by the red wood ant <span class="txt-italic">Formica yessensis</span> on the island of Hokkaido, northern Japan. As expected, in the presence of predators, aphid colonies survived significantly longer when attended by ants than when ants were excluded (<span id="widget-62835" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62835" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.14a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62835"></div>).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">The dispersal of seeds and pollen</h2>
<p class="para">Very many plant species use animals to disperse their seeds and pollen. About 10% of all flowering plants possess seeds or fruits that bear hooks, barbs, or glues that become attached to the hairs, bristles, or feathers of any animal that comes into contact with them. They are frequently an irritation to the animal, which often cleans itself and removes them if it can, but usually after carrying them some distance. In these cases the benefit is only to the plant (which has invested resources in attachment mechanisms); there is no reward to the animal and no mutualism as such.</p>
<p class="para indent">Quite different are the true mutualisms between higher plants and the birds and other animals that feed on fleshy fruits, dispersing the seeds. Of course, for the relationship to be mutualistic, it is essential that the animal digests only the fleshy fruit and not the seeds, which must remain viable when regurgitated or defecated. Thick strong defenses that protect plant embryos from digestion are usually part of the price paid by the plant for dispersal by fruit-eaters.</p>
<p class="para indent">In addition, many different kinds of animals have entered into pollination liaisons with flowering plants, including hummingbirds, bats, and even small rodents and marsupials. Most animal-pollinated flowers offer nectar, pollen, or both as a reward to their visitors. The evolution of specialized flowers, and of specialized animal pollinators, will be favored because a specialist pollinator may be able to recognize and discriminate between different flowers, moving pollen between different flowers of the same species but not to flowers of other species. Thus, where the vectors and flowers are highly specialized, as is the case in many orchids, virtually no pollen is wasted. By contrast, passive transfer of pollen, for example by wind or water, does not discriminate in this way and is therefore much more wasteful.</p>

<p class="para">insect pollinators: from generalists to ultraspecialists</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The pollinators par excellence are, without doubt, the insects. Pollen is a nutritionally rich food resource, and in the simplest insect-pollinated flowers, it is offered freely and in abundance to all and sundry. The plants rely for pollination on the insects being less than wholly efficient in their pollen consumption, carrying their spilled food with them from plant to plant. In more complex flowers, nectar (a solution of sugars) is produced as an additional or alternative reward. The nectar seems to have no value to the plant other than as an attractant to animals, and it has a cost to the plant, because the carbohydrates in nectar might have been used in growth or some other activity.</p>
<p class="para indent">In the simplest of these plants, the nectaries are unprotected, but, with increasing specialization, nectaries are enclosed in structures that restrict access to the nectar to just a few visitor species. This range can be seen within the family Ranunculaceae (<span id="widget-62837" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62837" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.15</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62837"></div>). In the simple flower of <span class="txt-italic">Ranunculus ficaria</span>, the nectaries are exposed to all visitors, but in the more specialized flower of <span class="txt-italic">R. bulbosus</span>, there is a flap over the nectary, and in <span class="txt-italic">Aquilegia</span>, the nectaries have developed into long tubes and only visitors with long probosces (tongues) can reach the nectar.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Not all insect-pollinated plants (and not all pollinating insects) are specialists, of course; there is an evolutionary balance to be struck. Unprotected nectaries have the advantage of a ready supply of pollinators, but because these pollinators are unspecialized, they transfer much of the pollen to the flowers of other species. Protected nectaries have the advantage of efficient transfer of pollen by specialists to other flowers of the same species, but they rely on there being sufficient numbers of these specialists. Specialist insects have the advantage of an exclusive resource; generalists have the advantage of a more reliable supply, though they share it.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Mutualistic gut inhabitants</h2>
<p class="para">Most of the mutualisms discussed so far have depended on patterns of behavior, where neither species lives entirely within its partner. In many other mutualisms, one of the partners is integrated more or less permanently into the body cavity or even the cells of its partner. The microorganisms occupying parts of various animals’ alimentary canals, called the <span class="txt-bold">gut microbiota</span>, are the best-known extracellular symbionts.</p>
<p class="para indent">The crucial role of microbes in the digestion of cellulose by vertebrate herbivores has long been appreciated, but it now appears that the gastrointestinal tracts of all vertebrates are populated by a mutualistic microbiota. Protozoa and fungi are usually present, but the major contributors to these fermentation processes are bacteria. Their diversity is greatest in regions of the gut where the pH is relatively neutral and food retention times are relatively long.</p>
<p class="para indent">In small mammals like rodents, rabbits, and hares, the cecum is the main fermentation chamber, whereas in larger nonruminant mammals such as horses, the colon is the main site. In ruminants, like cattle and sheep, and in kangaroos and other marsupials, fermentation occurs in specialized stomachs. The basis of the mutualism is straightforward. The microbes receive a steady flow of substrates for growth in the form of food that has been eaten, chewed, and partly homogenized. They live within a chamber in which the pH and, in endotherms, temperature are regulated and anaerobic conditions are maintained. On the other side, the vertebrate hosts, especially the herbivores, receive nutrition from food that they would otherwise find literally indigestible.</p>
<p class="para indent">These mutualistic relationships are by no means confined to vertebrates. Many insects, for example, are equally reliant on their gut microbiota for digesting their food, as we saw in <span id="widget-62838" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62838" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62838"></div> for termites, which are incapable of digesting their woody food without their bacterial symbionts (see <span id="widget-62839" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62839" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62839"></div></span>). In fact, the benefits to the host may themselves not be confined to improved digestion.

It was natural to assume this was the result of the differing genotypes of the colonies. But that assumption was not borne out when the gut microbiota were transferred among the different colonies by feeding emerging worker bees feces, either from their own or from other colonies, and then test-infecting the workers with <span class="txt-italic">C. bombi</span>. The outcome of infection was determined not by the colony of origin of the bees (their genotype), but by the colony of origin of their gut microbes. As we become ever more able to manipulate even our own gut microbes, interest in what they provide is certain to increase.<p></p>

<p class="para">Most higher plants do not have roots we can view in isolation; they have mycorrhizas—intimate mutualisms between fungi and root tissue. Plants of only a few families, such as the Cruciferae, are exceptions. Broadly, the fungal networks in mycorrhizas capture nutrients from the soil, which they transport to the plants in exchange for carbon and energy in return. Many plant species can live without their mycorrhizal fungi in soils where neither nutrients nor water are ever limiting, but in the harsh world of natural plant communities, the symbioses, if not strictly necessary, are nonetheless needed if the individuals are to survive in nature (Buscot et al., 2000).</p>
<p class="para indent">Three major types of mycorrhiza are recognized. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in about two-thirds of all plant species, including most nonwoody species and tropical trees (<span id="widget-62841" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62841" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 8.17a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62841"></div>).

The fungal mycelium also extends inward from the sheath, penetrating between the cells of the root cortex to give intimate cell-to-cell contact with the host and establishing an interface with a large surface area for the exchange of the products of photosynthesis, soil, water, and nutrients, between the host plant and its fungal partner. The ECM fungi are effective in extracting the sparse and patchy supplies of phosphorus and especially nitrogen from the forest litter layer. In the other direction, carbon flows from the plant to the fungus, very largely in the form of simple sugars: glucose and fructose.</p>
<p class="para indent">The plants pay a price. Fungal consumption of these sugars may represent up to 30% of the plants’ net rate of photosynthate production. The plants, though, are often nitrogen-limited, and much of that nitrogen is available as ammonia. It is therefore crucial for forest trees, on the other side of the balance sheet, that ECM fungi can access organic nitrogen directly through enzymic degradation and utilize ammonium as a preferred source of inorganic nitrogen. Nonetheless, the idea that there is a balance of costs and benefits for the plants is emphasized by their responsiveness to changing circumstances. ECM growth rate is high when the rate of flow of sugars from the plant is high. But when nitrate is plentifully available to the plants, plant metabolism is directed away from sugar production and towards amino acid synthesis. As a result, the ECM degrades: the plants seem to support just as much ECM as they need.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) do not form a sheath but penetrate <span class="txt-italic">within</span> the roots of the host. Roots become infected from mycelium present in the soil or from germ tubes that develop from asexual spores. Initially, the fungus grows between host cells, but eventually it enters them and forms a finely branched intracellular cluster called an <span class="txt-bold">arbuscule</span>, giving these mycorrhizas their name. Studies generally have tended to emphasize facilitation of phosphorus uptake as the main benefit to plants of AM symbioses (phosphorus is a highly immobile element in the soil, and it therefore frequently limits plants’ growth if they do not have the assistance of the mycorrhizas). The truth, however, appears to be more complex than this, with benefits demonstrated, too, in nitrogen uptake, pathogen and herbivore protection, and resistance to toxic metals (Newsham et al., 1995).</p>
<p class="para indent">To continue a theme that pervades this section, there is also clear evidence that the balance between benefits and costs changes with the ecological circumstances.

Cilantro, <span class="txt-italic">Coriandrum sativum</span>, was grown in experimental pots in Costa Rica with and without an inoculation of AM, at a range of phosphorus concentrations, and at high and low densities. When phosphorus concentrations were low, the benefits to the plant of having an AM root system to aid in accessing that phosphorus were clear, especially when resources were in relatively short supply at high densities. But with a relatively plentiful supply of phosphorus, and therefore less need among the plants for aid in accessing it, the plants performed best in the absence of an AM, whether growth was faster (low density) or slower (high density). Removing the need for the benefits that an AM can bring revealed its costs.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in mutualistic plants</h2>
<p class="para">The inability of the plants and animals to undertake the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is one of the great puzzles in the process of evolution, since nitrogen is in limiting supply in many habitats (see <span id="widget-62844" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62844" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62844"></div>). However, the ability to fix nitrogen is widely though irregularly distributed among both the eubacteria (‘true’ bacteria) and the archaea (Archaebacteria), and many of these have been caught up in tight mutualisms with distinct groups of eukaryotes. The best known, because of the huge agricultural importance of legume crops (peas, beans, and their relatives), are the <span class="txt-bold">rhizobia</span>, bacteria that fix nitrogen in the root nodules of most leguminous plants and just one nonlegume, <span class="txt-italic">Parasponia</span>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The establishment of the liaison between rhizobia and legume plants proceeds by a series of reciprocating steps. The bacteria occur in a free-living state in the soil and are stimulated to multiply by root exudates and cells that have been sloughed from roots as they develop. In a typical case, a bacterial colony develops on the root hair, which then begins to curl and is penetrated by the bacteria. The host responds by laying down a wall that encloses the bacteria and forms an <span class="txt-italic">infection thread</span>. This grows within the root, and the rhizobia proliferate within it. Rhizobia cannot fix nitrogen, but some are released into host cells in a developing nodule where, surrounded by a host-derived membrane, they differentiate into a particular form, called a bacteroid, that can fix nitrogen. Meanwhile, a special vascular system develops in the host, supplying the products of photosynthesis to the nodule tissue and carrying away fixed-nitrogen compounds to other parts of the plant.</p>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c08-feafxd-0014">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">costs and benefits of rhizobial mutualisms</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The costs and benefits of this mutualism need to be considered carefully. From the plant’s point of view, we need to compare the energetic costs of alternative ways of obtaining fixed nitrogen. The route for most plants is direct from the soil as nitrate or ammonium ions. The metabolically cheapest route is the use of ammonium ions, but in many soils most nitrogen is in the form of nitrates. For the plants alone, the unit energetic cost of reducing nitrate from the soil to ammonia is about 12 mol of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the cell’s energy currency). The mutualistic process with rhizobia is energetically slightly more expensive to the plant: about 13.5 mol of ATP.</p>
<p class="para indent">However, we must also add the costs of forming and maintaining the nodules, which may be about 12% of the plant’s total photosynthetic output. Hence, mutualistic nitrogen fixation is energetically inefficient. Energy, though, may be much more readily available for green plants than nitrogen. A rare and valuable commodity (fixed nitrogen), bought when you have more currency (energy) than you need, may be quite a bargain. On the other hand, in a pattern analogous to what we saw with the mycorrhizas, when a nodulated legume is provided with nitrates (that is, when nitrate is <span class="txt-italic">not</span> a rare commodity), nitrogen fixation declines rapidly.</p>
<p class="para indent">Of course, we must not think of the mutualisms of rhizobia and legumes (and other nitrogen-fixing mutualisms) as isolated interactions between bacteria and their own host plants. In nature, legumes normally form mixed stands in association with nonlegumes. These are potential competitors with the legumes for nitrogen. The nodulated legume sidesteps this competition by its access to its own unique source. It is in this ecological context that nitrogen-fixing mutualisms gain their main advantage. Where nitrogen is plentiful, however, the energetic costs of nitrogen fixation often put the plants at a competitive <span class="txt-italic">dis</span>advantage.</p>

The mixtures either received mineral nitrogen, or were inoculated with <span class="txt-italic">Rhizobium</span>, or both. The experiment was designed as a replacement series, which allows us to compare the growth of pure populations of the grass and the legume with their performances in the presence of each other, at a range of ratios. In the pure stands of soybean, yield was increased very substantially <span class="txt-italic">either</span> by inoculation with <span class="txt-italic">Rhizobium</span>, <span class="txt-italic">or</span> by application of fertilizer nitrogen, or both. The legumes can use either source of nitrogen as a substitute for the other. The grass, however, responded only to the fertilizer. Hence, when the species competed in the presence of <span class="txt-italic">Rhizobium</span> but with no fertilizer, the legume contributed far more to the overall yield than did the grass; over a succession of generations, the legume would have outcompeted the grass.

<p class="para indent">Quite clearly, then, it is in environments deficient in nitrogen that nodulated legumes have a great advantage over other species. But their activity raises the level of fixed nitrogen in the environment. After death, legumes augment the level of soil nitrogen on a very local scale, with a delay of weeks to months and even longer as they decompose. Thus, their advantage is lost; they have improved the environment of their competitors, and the growth of associated grasses will be favored in these local patches. In an important sense, organisms that can fix atmospheric nitrogen are locally suicidal. This is one reason why it is very difficult to grow repeated crops of pure legumes in agricultural practice without aggressive grass weeds invading the nitrogen-enriched environment. It may also explain why leguminous herbs or trees usually fail to form dominant stands in nature. Grazing animals, on the other hand, continually remove grass foliage, and the nitrogen status of a grass patch may again decline to a level at which the legume is at a competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="para indent">We end this section, then, on a theme that has recurred repeatedly. To understand the ecology of mutualistic pairs, we must look beyond those species to the wider community and ecosystem of which they are a part.</p>

<p class="para">For some purposes, knowing how much differentiation there is within species or between one species and another is critical. Molecular genetic markers, of a variety of types, have massively increased the resolution at which we can differentiate between populations and even individuals. Studies on albatrosses illustrate how even within a species of conservation importance, separate populations even more threatened with extinction may be hidden. Studies on commercial fish illustrate how molecular markers can be used to detect, and to prosecute, illegal fishermen. A threatened ‘species,’ the red wolf, may in fact be a hybrid between two other, relatively common species, with implications for both the desirability and the practicality of its conservation.</p>

<p class="para">Consumers and their living resources may become involved in coevolutionary ‘arms races.’ Plants relying on toxins are more prone to becoming involved in arms races with their herbivores than those relying on more ‘quantitative’ (digestion-reducing) chemicals. The intimate association between parasites and their hosts makes them especially prone to arms races. The evolution of resistance to the myxoma virus in the European rabbit is easy to understand, but the parasites favored by natural selection are those with the greatest reproductive rate, which occurs at intermediate levels of virulence because of increased transmissibility. In other cases, host–parasite coevolution is more definitely antagonistic—increasing resistance in the host and increasing infectivity in the parasite—a process that can be observed in action with bacteria and their viruses, because generation times are so short.</p>

<p class="para">A mutualistic relationship is one in which organisms of different species interact to their mutual benefit, though current evolutionary thinking views mutualisms as cases of reciprocal exploitation where nonetheless each partner is a <span class="txt-italic">net</span> beneficiary. Pairs of species from many taxa take part in mutualistic associations in which one species protects the other from predators or competitors but gains privileged access to a food resource on the protected species. ‘Farming’ mutualisms have developed not only in human agriculture, but also in termite and especially ant societies, where many species farm aphids in return for sugar-rich secretions of honeydew. Very many plant species use animals to disperse their seeds and pollen, and many different kinds of animals (but especially insects) have entered into pollination liaisons with flowering plants. The gastrointestinal tracts of many animals are populated by a mutualistic microbiota, essential for digestion. Most higher plants do not so much have roots as mycorrhizas—intimate mutualisms between fungi and root tissue—where the fungi play crucial roles especially in extracting nutrients from the soil. Finally, the ability to fix nitrogen is widely distributed among bacteria, and many of these have been caught up in tight mutualisms with distinct groups of eukaryotes, the best known of which are the rhizobia, which fix nitrogen in the root nodules of most leguminous plants.</p>

To provide complete answers for even a single species in a single location, we need to know the physicochemical conditions, the level of resources available, the organism’s life cycle, and the influence of competitors, predators, parasites, and so on—and how all these factors influence abundance through effects on birth, death, dispersal, and migration.

<p class="para indent">The raw material for the study of abundance is usually some estimate of the numbers of individuals in a population. However, a record of numbers alone can hide vital information. Picture three human populations, shown to contain identical numbers of individuals. One is an old people’s residential area, the second is a population of young children, and the third is a population of mixed age and sex. In the absence of information beyond mere numbers, it would not be clear that the first population was doomed to extinction (unless maintained by immigration), the second would grow fast but only after a delay, and the third would continue to grow steadily. The most satisfactory studies, therefore, estimate not only the numbers of individuals but also partition these into different age classes, sexes, and size groups.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Fluctuation or stability?</h2>
<p class="para">Some populations appear to change very little in size. One study of birds that covered an extended time span—though it was not necessarily the most scientific study—examined swifts (<span class="txt-italic">Micropus apus</span>) in the village of Selborne in southern England over more than 200 years. In one of the earliest published works on ecology, Gilbert White, who lived in the village, wrote in 1778 (see White, 1789):</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote">I am now confirmed in the opinion that we have every year the same number of pairs invariably…. The number that I constantly find are eight pairs, about half of which reside in the church, and the rest in some of the lowest and meanest thatched cottages.</p>
<p class="para indent">More than 200 years later, Lawton and May (1984) visited the village and, not surprisingly, found major changes. Swifts are unlikely to have nested in the church for 50 years, and the thatched cottages have either disappeared or had their roofs covered with wire. Yet the number of breeding pairs of swifts regularly to be found in the village is now 12. In view of the many changes that have taken place in the intervening centuries, this number is remarkably close to the eight pairs so consistently found by White.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Determination and regulation of abundance</h2>
<p class="para">Is the similarity between 8 and 12 pairs of swifts over 200 years most important, or the difference between them? Is it the irruptions in the abundance of Australian mice that are most interesting, or the predictable return to much lower levels? Should the overall decline in vole numbers be the focus of attention, or the change in numbers from one year to the next? Some investigators have emphasized the apparent constancy of populations; others have emphasized the fluctuations.</p>
<p class="para indent">Those who have emphasized constancy argue that we need to look for stabilizing forces <span class="txt-italic">within</span> populations to explain why they do not usually exhibit unfettered increase or a decline to extinction (even the decline in vole numbers in <span id="widget-62860" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62860" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.3b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62860"></div> appears to be leveling off).

<p class="para indent">On the other hand, the <span class="txt-bold">determination</span> of the precise abundance of individuals will reflect the combined effects of all the factors and all the processes that affect a population, whether they are dependent or independent of density (<span id="widget-62864" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62864" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.4b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62864"></div>). We must look at the determination of abundance, therefore, to understand how it is that a particular population exhibits a particular abundance at a particular time, and not some other abundance.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Some have taken extreme stances, believing that density-dependent, biotic interactions play the main role not only in regulating but also in determining population size. Those on the other side feel equally strongly that we should view most natural populations as passing through a repeated sequence of density-independent setbacks and recovery. But there is no need for any sharp polarization of views. What regulates population size and what determines population size are both interesting and important questions. No population can be absolutely free of regulation—long-term unrestrained population growth is unknown, and unrestrained declines to extinction are rare—and density-dependent processes are neither uncommon nor unimportant. For instance, density dependence was detected in more than 80% of studies of insect dynamics, as long as these studies lasted for more than 10 years (Hassell et al., 1989; Woiwod &amp; Hanski, 1992).</p>
<p class="para indent">On the other hand, for many populations, weather is the major determinant of abundance, and other factors are of relatively minor importance. For instance, in one classic study of a pest, the apple thrips, weather accounted for 78% of the annual variation in numbers and was therefore of paramount importance in predicting the thrips’ potential for crop damage (Davidson &amp; Andrewartha, 1948).</p>
<p class="para indent">So, what regulates the size of a population need not determine its size for most of the time. It would be wrong to give regulation or density dependence some kind of preeminence. Active regulation may be occurring only infrequently or intermittently, and it is likely that no natural population is ever truly at equilibrium: even when regulation is occurring, it may be drawing abundance toward a level that is itself changing in response to changing levels of resources. Thus, there are a range of possibilities: some populations in nature are almost always recovering from the last disaster, others are usually limited by an abundant or a scarce resource and are therefore constantly common or rare, and others are usually in decline after sudden episodes of colonization.</p>

For example, the very first row is labeled ‘Not deposited’ to describe eggs that were not so much killed as not laid by the adults carrying them in the first place.

<p class="para indent">It is also valuable, however, to ask a second question: “What is the relative importance of these phases as determinants of year-to-year <span class="txt-italic">fluctuations</span> in mortality, and hence of year-to-year fluctuations in abundance?” This is rather different. For instance, a phase might repeatedly witness a significant toll being taken from a population (a high mean <span class="equation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-130-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-309-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-309"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></script></span></span><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-130-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr></nobr></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-130"><m:math display="inline"><m:mi>k</m:mi></m:math></script></span>-value), but if that toll is always roughly the same, it may play little part in determining the particular population size in any particular year.</p>
<p class="para indent">We can address this second question in the following way. Mortality during a phase of the life cycle that is important in determining population change will vary in line with total mortality in terms of both size and direction. It will be a key phase if, when mortality during it is high, total mortality tends to be high and the population declines, whereas when phase mortality is low, total mortality tends to be low, and the population tends to remain large. By contrast, a phase with a <span class="equation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-131-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-310-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-310"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></script></span></span><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-131-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr></nobr></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-131"><m:math display="inline"><m:mi>k</m:mi></m:math></script></span>-value that varies quite randomly with respect to total <span class="equation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-132-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-311-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-311"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></script></span></span><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-132-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr></nobr></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-132"><m:math display="inline"><m:mi>k</m:mi></m:math></script></span> will have little influence on changes in mortality and population size.</p>
<p class="para indent">We need therefore to measure the relationship between phase mortality and total mortality, and this is achieved by the regression coefficient of the former on the latter. The largest regression coefficient will be associated with the key phase causing population change, whereas phase mortality that varies at random with total mortality will generate a regression coefficient close to zero. In <span id="widget-62872" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62872" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Table 9.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62872"></div>, the summer adults, with a regression coefficient of 0.906, are the key phase. Other phases (with the possible exception of older larvae) have a negligible effect on the changes in generation mortality. These first two questions, then, tell us something about the <span class="txt-italic">determination</span> of abundance in the population.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">What about the possible role of these phases in the <span class="txt-italic">regulation</span> of the Colorado beetle population, however? In other words, which, if any, act in a density-dependent way? We can answer this most easily by plotting <span class="equation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-133-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-312-Frame" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;"><nobr aria-hidden="true"></nobr><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-312"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>k</mi></math></script></span></span><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-133-Frame" tabindex="0" style=""><nobr></nobr></span><script type="math/mml" id="MathJax-Element-133"><m:math display="inline"><m:mi>k</m:mi></m:math></script></span>-values for each phase against the numbers present at the start of the phase.

For the beetle population, two phases are notable in this respect: for both summer adults (the key phase) and older larvae, there is evidence that losses are density-dependent (<span id="widget-62873" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62873" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62873"></div>). Hence, both have a possible role in regulating the size of the beetle population. In this case, therefore, the phases with the largest role in determining abundance are also those that seem likely to play the largest part in regulating abundance. But as we see next, this is by no means a general rule.<p></p>

The larval period was the key phase determining abundance in all regions, largely as a result of year-to-year variations in rainfall.

<p class="para indent">Such mortality, however, was inconsistently related to the size of the larval population (only one of two ponds in Maryland, and only approaching significance in Virginia), and hence it played an inconsistent part in regulating the sizes of the populations. Rather, in two regions it was during the adult phase that mortality was clearly density-dependent (apparently as a result of competition for food), and, indeed, in two regions mortality was also most intense in the adult phase (first data column).

<p class="para">In many studies of abundance, researchers have assumed that the major events all occur within the study area, and that immigrants and emigrants can safely be ignored. But migration can be a vital factor in determining and/or regulating abundance. We have already seen, for example, that emigration was the predominant reason for the loss of summer adults of the Colorado potato beetle, which was both the key phase in determining population fluctuations and one in which loss was strongly density-dependent.</p>

<p class="para">habitable sites and dispersal distance</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Dispersal has a particularly important role to play when populations are fragmented and patchy, as many are. We can think of the abundance of patchily distributed organisms as being determined by two things: first, the size of, and distance between, the species’ habitable sites, and second, the species’ typical dispersal distance. Thus, a population may be small if its habitable sites are small or short-lived, or only few in number. But it may also be small if the dispersal distance between habitable sites is great relative to the dispersibility of the species, such that habitable sites that go extinct are unlikely to be recolonized (Gadgil, 1971).</p>
<p class="para indent">We can illustrate this for a number of butterfly species, because their larvae feed on only one or a few species of patchily distributed plants, and it is therefore possible to identify habitable sites (containing these plant species) that are not inhabited. For example, the violet copper butterfly, <span class="txt-italic">Lycaena helle</span>, one of the rarest butterfly species in Central Europe, was studied in the Westerwald region in Germany, where it is confined to patches of habitat containing adderwort, <span class="txt-italic">Bistorta officinalis</span>, its only larval food plant in the area. This was one of several features used to classify a habitat patch as suitable for the violet copper, giving 230 patches in total. These patches were then surveyed to determine whether they were occupied by the butterfly, and what features distinguished occupied from vacant patches. Some of the results are shown in <span id="widget-62878" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62878" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62878"></div>.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Three factors had a significant influence on occupancy. Patches were more likely to be occupied the higher the percentage of the ground covered by adderwort—an indicator of patch quality from the butterflies’ point of view. But occupancy was also more likely in larger patches and in patches that were less isolated from other occupied sites. As with many rare species, overall abundance was being limited, at least in part, not simply by a lack of habitat but by difficulties in reaching it.</p>

<p class="para">A classic book, <span class="txt-italic">The Theory of Island Biogeography</span>, written by Robert MacArthur and Edward Wilson and published in 1967, was an important catalyst in radically changing ecological theory. MacArthur and Wilson showed how the distribution of species on islands could be interpreted as a balance between the opposing forces of extinction and colonization (see <span id="widget-62880" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62880" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 10</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62880"></div>), and they focused attention especially on situations where those species available for colonization all derived from a common source—the mainland. They developed their ideas in the context of the communities inhabiting oceanic islands, but their thinking has been rapidly assimilated into much wider contexts, with the realization that patches everywhere have many of the properties of true islands—ponds as islands of water in a sea of land, trees as islands in a sea of grass, and so on.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">At about the same time as MacArthur and Wilson’s book was published, a simple model of metapopulation dynamics was proposed by Richard Levins (1969). Levins introduced the concept of a metapopulation to refer to a subdivided and patchy population in which the population dynamics operate at two levels:</p>

It is not necessary to go into the details of Levins’s model; suffice to say that as long as the intrinsic rate of colonization exceeds the intrinsic rate of extinction within patches, the total metapopulation will reach a stable, equilibrium fraction of occupied patches, even if none of the local populations is stable in its own right.</p>
<p class="para indent">Perhaps because of the powerful influence on ecology of MacArthur and Wilson’s theory, the idea of metapopulations was largely neglected during the 20 years after Levins’s initial work. The 1990s, however, saw a great flowering of interest, both in the underlying theory and in populations in nature that might conform to the metapopulation concept. Much of this interest was driven by the Finnish ecologist Ilkka Hanski, who in 2011 was awarded the prestigious international Crafoord Prize for his work by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p class="para indent">We can describe a population as a metapopulation when it consists of a collection of subpopulations, each one of which has a realistic chance both of going extinct and of appearing again through recolonization. Thus, compared to more conventional views of population dynamics, in thinking in terms of metapopulations we give less emphasis to the birth, death, and movement processes going on within a single subpopulation, but much more to the colonization (= birth) and extinction (= death) of whole subpopulations. Put simply, metapopulations may persist, stably, as a result of the balance between extinctions and recolonizations, even though none of the local subpopulations is stable in its own right.</p>
<p class="para indent">An example of this is shown in <span id="widget-62881" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62881" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.8</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62881"></div>, where a metapopulation of solitary bees, <span class="txt-italic">Andrena hattorfiana</span>, in southern Sweden was surveyed several times each year from 2003 to 2006. Habitat patches (potential subpopulations) were those containing the bee’s main pollen source, <span class="txt-italic">Knautia arvensis</span>, and it is clear that from one year to the next, the chance for an individual subpopulation to go extinct (or a vacant patch to be colonized) was extremely high. The metapopulation was stable, the subpopulations were not; only 16% of the subpopulations remained occupied throughout the study. Those with the smallest bee populations were most likely to go extinct; those covering the largest area were most likely to be colonized.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The dynamics of individual subpopulations were not monitored, but these were simulated using models based on the principles of metapopulation dynamics and on general information about pika biology. When each of the three networks was simulated in isolation (<span id="widget-62886" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62886" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.10b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62886"></div>), the northern network remained at a stable high occupancy (as observed in the data), but the middle network rapidly and predictably crashed, and the southern network eventually suffered the same fate. However, when the entire metapopulation was simulated as a single entity (<span id="widget-62887" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62887" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.10c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62887"></div></span>), the northern network again achieved stable high occupancy, but this time the middle network was also stable, although at a much lower occupancy (again as observed), while the southern network suffered periodic collapses (also consistent with the real data).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">This all suggests that within the metapopulation as a whole, the northern network acts as a net source of colonizers that prevent the middle network from suffering overall extinction. These in turn delay extinction in, and allow recolonization of, the southern network. The study therefore illustrates how whole metapopulations can be stable when their individual subpopulations are not. Moreover, the comparison of the northern and middle networks, both stable but at very different occupancies, shows how occupancy may depend on the size of the pool of dispersers, which itself may depend on the size and number of the subpopulations.</p>

<p class="para">transient dynamics may be as important as equilibria</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Finally, the southern network in particular emphasizes that the observable dynamics of a metapopulation may have more to do with transient behavior, far from any equilibrium, than with the theoretical equilibrium state itself. To take another example, the silver-spotted skipper butterfly (<span class="txt-italic">Hesperia comma</span>) declined steadily in Great Britain from a widespread distribution over most calcareous hills in 1900, to 46 or fewer refuge localities (local populations) in 10 regions by the early 1960s (Thomas &amp; Jones, 1993). The probable reasons were changes in land use—increased plowing of grasslands, reduced stocking with grazing animals—and the virtual elimination of rabbits by myxomatosis with its consequent profound vegetational changes. Throughout this nonequilibrium period, rates of local extinction generally exceeded those of recolonization.</p>
<p class="para indent">In the 1970s and 1980s, however, reintroduction of livestock and recovery of the rabbits led to increased grazing, and suitable habitats increased again. This time, recolonization exceeded local extinction, but the spread of the skipper remained slow, especially into localities isolated from the 1960s refuges. Even in southeast England, where the density of refuges was greatest, it is predicted that the abundance of the butterfly will increase only slowly—and remain far from equilibrium—for at least 100 years. Thus, it seems that around a century of transient decline in the dynamics of the metapopulation is to be followed by another century of transient increase – except that the environment will no doubt alter again before the transient phase ends and, most likely, a new transient phase begins.</p>

<p class="para">metapopulations of plants? remember the seed bank</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Finally, we must be wary of assuming that all patchy populations are truly metapopulations, that is, that every subpopulation has a measurable probability of going extinct or being recolonized. In particular, there is no doubt that many plants inhabit patchy environments, and apparent extinctions of local populations may be common, but the suggestion that recolonizations following a genuine extinction are common is nonetheless questionable in any species that has a buried seed bank (see <span id="widget-62888" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62888" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 5.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62888"></div>). Recolonizations may often simply be the result of the germination of seeds following habitat restoration. Recolonization by dispersal, a prerequisite for a true metapopulation, may be extremely rare.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">There are, though, at least some examples of plant metapopulations, including where the application of molecular methods (see <span id="widget-62889" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62889" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 8.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62889"></div>) has proved invaluable. One such study looked at an annual plant, the treacle mustard, <span class="txt-italic">Erisymum cheiranthoides</span>, that occupies sites on stony banks of the River Meuse in Belgium (<span id="widget-62890" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62890" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.11a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62890"></div></span>). As an annual, the species clearly shows no continuity of adults at a site from one year to the next, but individual sites are subject to flooding each winter, which may be powerful enough to also flush away all seeds from a site, leading to extinction of a subpopulation. The river, though, may also bring new seeds (colonists) to a site.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Founder-controlled and dominance-controlled communities</h2>
<p class="para">The metapopulation concept is important for our understanding of population dynamics, because it acknowledges that a combination of patchiness and dispersal between patches can give rise to dynamics quite different from those that would be observed if there were just one, homogeneous patch. We can apply the same thinking to community organization.</p>
<p class="para indent">Disturbances that open up gaps are common in many kinds of community. Gaps are simply patches within which many species suffer local extinction simultaneously. In forests, high winds, elephants, or simply the death of a tree through old age may all create gaps. In grassland, agents include frost, burrowing animals, and cattle dung. On rocky shores, gaps may be formed as a result of severe wave action during hurricanes, battering by moored boats, or the action of predators. Gaps in a community are ripe for colonization, and two fundamentally different kinds of community organization can be recognized (Yodzis, 1986). When all species are good colonists and essentially equal competitors, communities are described as founder controlled. When some species are strongly superior competitively, communities can be described as dominance controlled. The dynamics of the two are quite different, and we deal with them in turn.</p>

On each occasion that a population goes locally extinct, a gap is opened up for invasion. Hence, if gaps are appearing continually and randomly, and all conceivable replacements are possible, <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c09-tdef-0005" title="the number of species present in a community" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - species richness">species richness</span> – simply the total number of species in a community – is maintained at a high level in the system as a whole. Such competitive lotteries have been hypothesized, especially for communities of tropical reef fish (Sale &amp; Douglas, 1984). These are extremely rich in species.</p>
<p class="para indent">The number of fish species on the Great Barrier Reef, for example, ranges from 900 in the south to 1500 in the north, and more than 50 resident species may be recorded on a single patch of reef 3 m in diameter. Only a proportion of this species richness is likely to be attributable to resource partitioning of food and space, since the diets of many of the coexisting species are very similar. Rather, it has been proposed that the crucial limiting factor is vacant living space, generated unpredictably in space and time when a resident dies or is killed. The fish species, then, breed often, sometimes year-round, and produce numerous clutches of dispersive eggs or larvae that compete in a lottery for living space in which larvae are the tickets. The first arrival at the vacant space wins the site, matures quickly, and holds the space for its lifetime.</p>
<p class="para indent">While the idea is plausible, there is little direct evidence for such competitive lotteries, certainly at the whole community level. There are, though, good examples of one key element of the process: a <span class="txt-bold">priority effect</span> between competing species, in which the species that arrives first at a site is able to hold it against competing invaders, whatever the outcome would be if they competed as simultaneously arriving equals.

<p class="para">If an opened-up gap has not previously been influenced by a community, we refer to the sequence of species as a <span class="txt-bold">primary succession</span>. Examples include lava flows caused by volcanic eruptions, substrate exposed by the retreat of a glacier, and freshly formed sand dunes. But where the species of an area has been partially or completely removed but seeds and spores remain, we call the subsequent sequence a <span class="txt-bold">secondary succession</span>. The loss of trees locally as a result of high winds may lead to secondary successions, as can cultivation followed by the abandonment of farmland (so-called old-field successions).</p>
<p class="para indent">Primary successions often take several hundreds of years to run their course, though on recently denuded rocks on a seashore, for instance, a primary succession may take only a decade or so. The research life of an ecologist is long enough to follow the latter but not, for example, the succession following a glacial retreat. Fortunately, however, we can sometimes gain information over the longer time scale, because different stages of the succession may be represented by community gradients in space. For example, as a glacier retreats, the first stage of the succession may be observed just beyond its tip, with later stages strung out further down the glacial valley. We can then use this series of communities currently in existence – or <span class="txt-bold">chronosequence</span>—to infer what the succession must have been.</p>

<p class="para indent">Successions on old fields have been studied primarily in the eastern and northern United States, where many farms were abandoned by farmers who moved west after the frontier was opened up in the 19th century, and where indeed farmland continued to be abandoned through much of the 20th century in some places. Most of the precolonial mixed forest had previously been destroyed by the farmers, but regeneration was swift after the ‘disturbance’ caused by farmers came to an end. The early pioneers of the U.S. West left behind exposed land that was colonized by pioneers of a very different kind. The typical sequence of dominant vegetation is: annual weeds → herbaceous perennials → shrubs → early successional trees → late successional trees. A particularly detailed study of old-field succession performed at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area in Minnesota was discussed in detail in <span id="widget-62899" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62899" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 1.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62899"></div>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Old-field succession has also been studied at a site in Lower Saxony, Germany, going back to 1968. We can divide the communities there into four broad types. The earliest, lasting only around two years, is dominated by short-lived annuals. The second, dominated by perennial herbs and grasses, lasts to around the eighth year and is followed by a shrub-dominated stage. Then, from around 14 years, the community is pioneer forest. The first stage is initiated by the germination of seeds, either from the seed bank or blown in. Thereafter, new colonizers also drive the transition from the first to the second stage (<span id="widget-62900" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62900" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.15a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62900"></div>), but colonization declines in importance over subsequent transitions.<p></p>

They cannot persist in competition with later species, and thus they must grow and consume the available resources rapidly.

With stages ranging from 0–5 years after abandonment (stage 1) to &gt; 100 years (stage 5), the plants tended to have higher rates of photosynthesis and faster rates of growth in the earlier stages, but they lived short lives with short reproductive periods in which they produced light (more easily dispersed) seeds. Late arrivals tend to be those with heavier seeds, poorer dispersal, and long juvenile phases. The contrast is between two lifestyles: ‘Quickly come, quickly gone,’ and ‘What I have, I hold.’<p></p>

<p class="para">Some endangered animal species are associated with particular stages of a succession. Their conservation then depends on a full understanding of the successional sequence, and intervention may be required to maintain their habitat at an appropriate successional stage.</p>
<p class="para indent">An intriguing example is provided by a giant New Zealand insect, the weta, <span class="txt-italic">Deinacrida mahoenuiensis</span> (Orthoptera, Anostostomatidae). This species, which is believed to have been formerly widespread in forest habitat, was discovered in the 1970s in an isolated patch of gorse (<span class="txt-italic">Ulex europaeus</span>). Ironically, in New Zealand gorse is an introduced weed that farmers spend much time and effort attempting to control. However, its dense, prickly sward provides a refuge for the giant weta against other introduced pests, particularly rats but also hedgehogs, stoats, and possums, which could readily capture wetas in their original forest home. Mammalian predation is believed to be responsible for weta extinction elsewhere.</p>
<p class="para indent">New Zealand’s Department of Conservation purchased this important patch of gorse from the landowner, who insisted that his cattle should still be permitted to overwinter in the reserve. Conservationists were unhappy about this, but the cattle subsequently proved to be part of the weta’s salvation. By opening up paths through the gorse, cattle provided entry for feral goats that browse the gorse, producing a dense hedge-like sward and preventing the habitat from succeeding to a stage inappropriate to the wetas.</p>
<p class="para indent">This story therefore features a single, endangered, endemic insect together with a whole suite of introduced pests (gorse, rats, goats) and introduced domestic animals (cattle). Before the arrival of people in New Zealand, the island’s only land mammals were bats, and New Zealand’s endemic fauna have proven to be extraordinarily vulnerable to the mammals that arrived with people. However, by maintaining gorse succession at an early stage, the grazing goats provide a habitat in which the wetas can escape the attentions of rats and other predators.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">Because of its economic cost to farmers, ecologists have been trying to find an appropriate biological control agent for gorse, ideally one that would eradicate it. How would you weigh up the needs of a rare insect against the economic losses associated with gorse on farms?</span></p>

Do real successions reach a climax? Some may. The succession of seaweeds on an overturned boulder may reach a climax in only a few years. Old-field successions, on the other hand, might take 100–300 years to reach a climax, but in that time the probabilities of fire or severe hurricanes, which occur every 70 or so years in New England, for example, are so high that a process of succession may never go to completion. Given that forest communities in northern temperate regions, and probably also in the tropics, are still recovering from the last glaciation, it is questionable whether the idealized climax vegetation is often reached in nature.<p></p>

<p class="para">successions in a patchwork—the size and shape of gaps</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In fact, our decision about whether a climax has been reached, like so much else in ecology, is likely to be a matter of scale. As we saw above, many successions take place in a mosaic of patches, with each patch, having been disturbed independently, at a different successional stage. Boulders on a rocky shore are a good example. Climax communities in such cases can then occur, at best, only on a very local scale. Moreover, when successions occur in a patchwork, the nature of the succession, both locally and overall, is likely to depend on the size and shape of the patches (gaps). The centers of very large gaps are most likely to be colonized by individuals that have traveled relatively great distances. But such mobility is less important in small gaps, since much of the recolonization will be by established individuals from around the periphery.</p>
<p class="para indent">Intertidal beds of mussels provide excellent opportunities to study the formation and the filling-in of gaps. In the absence of disturbance, mussel beds may persist as extensive monocultures. More often, they are an ever-changing mosaic of many species that inhabit gaps formed by the action of waves. The size of these gaps at the time of formation ranges from a single mussel space to hundreds of square meters. Gaps begin to fill as soon as they are formed. An experimental study of mussel beds of <span class="txt-italic">Brachidontes solisianus</span> and <span class="txt-italic">B. darwinianus</span> in Brazil aimed to determine the effects of patch size and location within a patch on the dynamics of succession (<span id="widget-62912" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62912" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.18</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62912"></div>).<p></p>

After around 6 months, too, the <span class="txt-italic">Brachiodontes</span> mussels, which cannot be identified to species when they are small, recruited significantly from larvae that settled into the central areas of the large gaps (<span id="widget-62916" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62916" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.18b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62916"></div></span>). Finally, the barnacle <span class="txt-italic">Chthamalus bisinuatus</span> also recruited from settled larvae, largely as a pulse after around 6 months, especially in the largest gaps (<span id="widget-62917" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62917" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.18a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62917"></div></span>) and more in the center than at the periphery of the large gaps (<span id="widget-62918" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62918" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.18b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62918"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Thus, the smaller the gap, the more the succession within it was dominated by lateral movement than by true migration, and even within a large gap, succession proceeded differently at the center and at the periphery. On the shore as a whole, therefore, as in any patchy and disturbed habitat, there was a mosaic of patches in different successional states, with those states being determined by patch size, the time since the last disturbance, and even location within a patch.</p>

<p class="para indent">We now take this approach a stage further to focus on systems with at least three trophic levels (primary producer–herbivore–predator) and consider not only direct but also indirect effects that a species may have on others at the same or at other trophic levels. The effects of a predator on populations of its herbivorous prey, for example, are direct and relatively straightforward. But effects may also be felt by any plant population on which the herbivore feeds, other predators of the herbivore, other consumers of the plant, competitors of the herbivore, or the myriad species linked even more remotely in the food web.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c09-sec-0015">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Indirect and direct effects</h2>
<p class="para">The deliberate removal of a species from a community can be a powerful tool in unraveling the workings of a food web. We might expect such removal to lead to an increase in the abundance of a competitor, or, if the species removed is a predator, to an increase in the abundance of its prey. Sometimes, however, when a species is removed, a competitor may actually decrease in abundance, and the removal of a predator can lead to a decrease in a prey population. Such unexpected effects arise when direct effects are less important than effects that occur through indirect pathways. For example, removal of a species might increase the density of one competitor, which in turn causes another competitor to decline.</p>
<p class="para indent">These indirect effects are brought especially into focus when the initial removal is carried out for some managerial reason, since the deliberate aim is to solve a problem, not create further, unexpected problems. For example, there are many islands on which feral cats have been allowed to escape domestication and now threaten native prey, especially birds, with extinction. The seemingly obvious response is to eliminate the cats and conserve their island prey, but as a simple model shows (<span id="widget-62924" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62924" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.19</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62924"></div>), such programs may not have the desired effect, especially where, as is often the case, rats have also been allowed to colonize the island.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The cats normally prey upon the rats as well as the birds, while the rats typically both compete with and prey upon the birds. Hence, removal of the cats will increase the abundance of rats and may thus increase rather than decrease the threat to the birds. For example, cats introduced on Stewart Island, New Zealand, preyed upon an endangered flightless parrot, the kakapo, <span class="txt-italic">Strigops habroptilus</span> (Karl &amp; Best, 1982). But controlling cats alone would have been risky, since their preferred prey are three species of introduced rats that, unchecked, could pose far more of a threat to the kakapo. To solve the problem, conservationists translocated Stewart Island’s kakapo population to smaller offshore islands where exotic predators like rats were absent.</p>

There were also lizards (top carnivores) that fed on both the spiders and the herbivores. When lizards were removed from experimental plots and results were compared to controls, the subtlety arose because there were different types of herbivores, and because the lizards ate large numbers of plant-sucking homopterans but very few gall-forming midges (which were mostly eaten by the spiders). Therefore, for the damage caused to the plants by the midges, the expected four-level alternation was observed. Removing lizards benefitted the plants. However, removing the lizards also directly and significantly benefitted the homopterans, which in turn harmed the plants, so in this regard at least, the four trophic–level community functioned as if it had only three levels.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">A final example of a trophic cascade is provided by another aquatic example—a comparison of lakes in Wisconsin with either fish-eating bass or plankton-eating minnows at the top trophic level. When the bass are present, they effectively eliminate these plankton-eaters. This has the potential to reduce the grazing pressure on the zooplankton, allowing them to increase their own grazing pressure on the phytoplankton, cascading down to reduce phytoplankton abundance. In fact, however, this full cascade was observed only if the communities were also subjected to an experimental addition of nutrients (<span id="widget-62929" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62929" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.22</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62929"></div>).

<p class="para">top-down or bottom-up control of food webs?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">We have seen, therefore, that trophic cascades are generally viewed from the top, starting at the highest trophic level. So, in a three-trophic–level community, we think of the predators controlling the abundance of the herbivores—so-called top-down control. Reciprocally, the predators are subject to bottom-up control: their abundance is determined by their resources. With these three levels, the plants are also subject to bottom-up control, having been released from top-down control by the effects of the predators on the herbivores. Thus, in a trophic cascade, top-down and bottom-up controls alternate as we move from one trophic level to the next. But suppose instead that we start at the other end of the food chain, and assume the plants are controlled bottom-up by competition for their resources. It is still possible for the herbivores to be limited by competition for plants—<span class="txt-italic">their</span> resources—and for the predators to be limited by competition for herbivores. In this scenario, all trophic levels are subject to bottom-up control, because the resource controls the abundance of the consumer but the consumer does not control the abundance of the resource.</p>
<p class="para indent">Of course, it must often be the case that top-down and bottom-up effects combine. We saw an example in <span id="widget-62930" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62930" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.22</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62930"></div>, where the top-down effects of the fish-eating bass on the phytoplankton were apparent only when the phytoplankton were supplied, bottom up, with sufficient nutrients. Nonetheless, it is possible to find examples of bottom-up control to set alongside the trophic cascades described above. In one study in Brazil, for example, the perennial shrub, <span class="txt-italic">Chromolaena pungens</span>, was subjected to two levels of clipping—either around 50% of leaves were removed or the plant was cut at the base – and allowed to regrow. Clipping generally is known to give rise to poorly defended, nutrient-rich foliage in the rapidly (re-)growing plants, which were then compared to unclipped control plants, in terms of the plants’ own traits, and in terms of the herbivores and predators in the two trophic levels above. Partial clipping had relatively little effect, but fully clipped plants grew faster and had larger leaves and were much less likely to flower (<span id="widget-62931" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62931" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.23a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62931"></div></span>).

<p class="para">why is the world green?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">There are examples, then, of both top-down and bottom-up control, but the question nonetheless arises – are food webs, or are particular <span class="txt-italic">types</span> of food web, dominated by either one or the other? The widespread importance of top-down control was first advocated in a famous paper by Hairston et al. (1960), which asked ‘Why is the world green?’ The authors answered, in effect, that the world is green because top-down control predominates: green plant biomass accumulates because predators keep herbivores in check. Murdoch (1966), in particular, challenged these ideas. His view, described by Pimm (1991) as ‘the world is prickly and tastes bad,’ emphasized that even if the world is green (assuming it is), it does not necessarily follow that the herbivores are failing to capitalize on this because they are limited, top down, by their predators. Many plants have evolved physical and chemical defenses that make life difficult for herbivores. The herbivores may therefore be competing fiercely for a limited amount of palatable and unprotected plant material, and their predators may, in turn, compete for scarce herbivores. A world controlled from the bottom up may still be green.</p>
<p class="para indent">The appeal of general rules is understandable, but it remains a challenge for the future to discover whether top-down or bottom-up control predominates in particular types of communities. Indeed, it is likely that in many communities, both forces have a role to play. Nonetheless, there have been several <span class="txt-bold">meta-analyses</span>—structured analyses of large numbers of data sets with a view to discerning consistent trends—of the large number of studies of possible top-down or bottom-up control, and the results of one of these are shown in <span id="widget-62934" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62934" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.24</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62934"></div>. Predator manipulation experiments consistently reveal a significant negative effect of the predators on herbivores, and a somewhat less profound but nonetheless significant positive, top-down, trophic cascade effect of the predators on the plants (<span id="widget-62935" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62935" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.24a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62935"></div></span>). However, while fertilization experiments consistently have a significant bottom-up positive effect on the plants themselves, there is no evidence overall for this effect being transmitted further up the food chain to the herbivores, whether or not there are predators present as well (<span id="widget-62936" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62936" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.24b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62936"></div></span>).

<p class="para">Of all the imaginable food webs in nature, are there particular types that we tend to observe repeatedly? Are some food web structures more stable than others? Do we observe particular types of food web <span class="txt-italic">because</span> they are stable (and hence persist)?

<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">What Do We Mean by ‘Stability’?</h5>
<section class="section-5" id="c09-sec-0017">
<p class="para">In trying to decide what we mean by stability, we should first draw a distinction between the resilience of a community and its resistance. A <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c09-tdef-0009" title="the speed with which a community returns to its former state after it has been disturbed" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - resilient community">resilient community</span> is one that returns rapidly to something like its former structure after that structure has been altered. A <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c09-tdef-0010" title="the ability of a community to avoid displacement from its present state by a disturbance" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - resistant community">resistant community</span> is one that undergoes relatively little change in its structure in the face of a disturbance.</p>
<p class="para indent">A second distinction is between fragile and robust stability. A community has only <span class="txt-bold">fragile stability</span> if it remains essentially unchanged in the face of a small disturbance but alters utterly when subjected to a larger disturbance. By contrast, a community is <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c09-tdef-0011" title="describes a community which is stable within a wide range of environmental conditions" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - dynamically robust">dynamically robust</span> if it stays roughly the same in the face of much larger disturbances.</p>
<p class="para indent">To illustrate these distinctions by analogy, consider the following:</p>
<ul class="unorder-list" epub:type="list" id="c09-list-0003">
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">a pool or billiard ball balanced carefully on the end of a cue</p></li>
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">the same ball resting on the table</p></li>
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para">the ball sitting snugly in its pocket</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="para indent">The ball on the cue is stable in the narrow sense that it will stay there forever as long as it is not disturbed—but its stability is fragile, and both its resistance and its resilience are low: the slightest touch will send the ball to the ground, far from its former state (low resistance), and it has not the slightest tendency to return to its former position (low resilience).</p>
<p class="para indent">The same ball resting on the table has a similarly low resilience. It has no tendency to return to exactly its former state (assuming the table is level), but its resistance is far higher; pushing or hitting it moves it relatively little. And its stability is also relatively robust. It remains ‘a ball on the table’ in the face of all sorts and all strengths of assault with the cue.</p>
<p class="para indent">The ball in the pocket, finally, is not only resistant but resilient too—it moves little and then returns—and its stability is highly robust. It will remain where it is in the face of almost everything, other than a hand that carefully plucks it away.</p>

<p class="para">keystone species</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Whatever meaning we use, ‘stability’ usually means stability in the face of a disturbance or perturbation, and most disturbances are, in practice, the loss of one or more populations from a community. What are the ripple effects of such a loss? How profound are the consequences of the loss of that population for the rest of the community? Consider that in building construction, a keystone is the wedge-shaped block at the highest point of an arch that locks the other pieces together. The removal of the keystone in an arch leads to the collapse of the whole structure. Similarly, some species—strong interactors—are more intimately and tightly woven into the fabric of a food web than others, and the removal of these <span class="txt-italic">keystone species</span> leads to extinctions or large changes in abundance of several species, producing a community with a very different species composition.</p>
<p class="para indent">A more precise definition of a <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c09-tdef-0012" title="a species whose removal would produce a significant effect in the community of which it is part, changing its fundamental nature" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - keystone species">keystone species</span> is one whose impact on community composition is disproportionately large relative to its abundance (Power et al., 1996). This definition has the advantage of excluding from keystone status what would otherwise be rather trivial examples, especially species at lower trophic levels that may provide the resource on which myriad other species depend—for example, a coral, or the oak trees in an oak woodland.</p>
<p class="para indent">Although the term was originally applied only to predators, it is now widely accepted that keystone species can occur at any trophic level. For example, lesser snow geese (<span class="txt-italic">Chen caerulescens caerulescens</span>) are herbivores that breed in large colonies in coastal marshes along the west coast of Hudson Bay in Canada. At their nesting sites in spring, before growth of above-ground foliage begins, adult geese grub for the roots in dry areas and eat the swollen bases of shoots in wet areas. Their activity creates bare areas (1–5 m<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup>) of peat and sediment. Few pioneer plant species are able to recolonize these patches, and recovery is very slow. Furthermore, in areas of intense summer grazing, lawns of <span class="txt-italic">Carex</span> and <span class="txt-italic">Puccinellia</span> spp. have become established. Overall, therefore, high densities of grazing geese are essential to maintain the species composition of the vegetation and its above-ground production (Kerbes et al., 1990). The lesser snow goose is a keystone species; the whole structure and composition of these communities are drastically altered by its presence.</p>

<p class="para">complexity leads to stability? what models suggest</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">A keystone species may be critical to the stability of a community, but are there characteristics of the community as a whole that stabilize it? For a long time, the conventional wisdom, arrived at largely through apparently logical argument, was that increased complexity within a community leads to increased stability (MacArthur, 1955; Elton, 1958). For example, it was thought that in more complex communities, with more species and more interactions, there were more possible pathways by which energy passed through the community. Hence, if there was a perturbation to the community—a change in the density of one of the species—this would affect only a small proportion of the energy pathways and would have relatively little effect on the densities of other species: the complex community would be resistant to change (<span id="widget-62939" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62939" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 9.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62939"></div>). However, when ecologists came to formalize their seemingly logical arguments into mathematical models of food webs, the conventional wisdom was by no means always supported (May, 1981; Tilman, 1999). Indeed, conclusions differ depending on whether we focus on individual populations within a community or on aggregate properties of the community such as its biomass or productivity.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Briefly, the model food webs have been characterized by one or more of the following: (i) the number of species they contain; (ii) the <span class="txt-bold">connectance</span> of the web, meaning the fraction of all possible pairs of species that interact directly with one another; and (iii) the average interaction strength between pairs of species. At the level of the individual population, models overall have tended to suggest that increases in the number of species, increases in connectance, and increases in average interaction strength—each representing an increase in complexity—all tend to <span class="txt-italic">decrease</span> the resilience of individual populations within the community, that is, their tendency to return to their former state following a disturbance (<span id="widget-62940" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62940" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.25</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62940"></div>). Thus, these models suggest, if anything, that community complexity leads to population <span class="txt-italic">instability</span>.<p></p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">However, the effects of complexity, especially species richness, on the stability of aggregate properties of model communities have been more consistent. Broadly, in richer communities, the dynamics of these aggregate properties are <span class="txt-italic">more</span> stable (<span id="widget-62941" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62941" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.25</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62941"></div>). The reason is largely that, as long as the fluctuations in different populations are not perfectly correlated, there is an inevitable statistical averaging effect when populations are added together—when one goes up, another is going down—and this tends to increase in effectiveness as richness (the number of populations) increases.<p></p>

The prediction that populations in richer communities are less stable when disturbed was investigated by Tilman (1996), who pooled data for 39 common plant species from 207 grassland plots in Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, collected over an 11-year period. He found that variation in the biomass of individual species increased significantly, but only very weakly, with the richness of the plots (<span id="widget-62945" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62945" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.27a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62945"></div>).

<p class="para indent">Turning to the aggregate, whole-community level, we find the evidence is largely consistent in supporting the prediction that increased richness in a community increases stability and decreases variability. For example, in Tilman’s Minnesota grasslands study, in contrast to the weak negative effect found at the population level, there was a strong positive effect of richness on the stability of community biomass (<span id="widget-62946" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62946" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.27b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62946"></div>).

<p class="para indent">On the other hand, in an experimental study of small grassland communities perturbed by an induced drought, Wardle et al. (2000) found detailed community composition to be a far better predictor of stability than overall richness. Indeed, the whole concept of a keystone species (see above) recognizes that the effects of a disturbance on structure or function are likely to depend very much on the precise nature of the disturbance, and in particular on <span class="txt-italic">which</span> species are lost.</p>
<p class="para indent">The theme of the fine detail being more important than the overall average is repeated, too, in the case of compartmentalization. Real food webs certainly seem to be more compartmentalized than we would expect from making merely random connections between even connectable species (<span id="widget-62948" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62948" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.26b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62948"></div>). It seems, however, that the compartmentalization itself may emerge naturally or even inevitably. For example, five major compartments were identified in an analysis of a Caribbean marine food web covering 3,313 trophic interactions between 249 species, and running from the surface to a depth of 100 m. It seems, though, that much of the subdivision between these compartments occurs either because members of different compartments simply occupy different habitats (shore or off-shore; <span id="widget-62949" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62949" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.29a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62949"></div></span>), or because the morphological constraints on each species confine them to feeding on prey in a particular size-range (<span id="widget-62950" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62950" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.29b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62950"></div></span>), or because the combinations of trophic levels occupied by each species bring them into closer connection with other species occupying similar levels (<span id="widget-62951" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62951" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.29c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62951"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Moreover, the facts that real food webs are compartmentalized, and that compartmentalization promotes stability, do not imply that food webs are compartmentalized <span class="txt-italic">because</span> of the stability this imparts. Rather, it helps explain why we can frequently observe complex food webs in nature, despite the fact that such complexity tends to promote instability. One reason, at least, is that they are compartmentalized.</p>
<p class="para indent">In fact, even if complexity and instability are connected in models, this does not necessarily mean we should expect to see an association between complexity and instability in real communities. In a stable and predictable environment, a community that is dynamically fragile may nevertheless persist.

Hence, we might expect to see: (i) complex and relatively fragile communities in stable and predictable environments, with simple and robust communities in variable and unpredictable environments, but (ii) approximately the same <span class="txt-italic">observed</span> stability (in terms of population fluctuations, and so forth) in all communities, since this will depend both on the inherent stability of the community itself and on the variability of the environment. One study supporting at least the first of these points investigated 10 small streams in New Zealand that differed in the intensity and frequency of flow-related disturbances to their beds (<span id="widget-62952" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62952" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 9.30</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62952"></div>).

<p class="para">Disturbances that open up gaps (patches) are common in all kinds of community. Founder-controlled communities are those in which all species are approximately equivalent in their ability to invade gaps and are equal competitors that can hold the gaps against all comers during their lifetime. Dominance-controlled communities are those in which some species are competitively superior to others so that an initial colonizer of a patch cannot necessarily maintain its presence there.</p>
<p class="para indent">The phenomenon of dominance control is responsible for many examples of community succession. Primary successions occur in habitats where no seeds or spores remain from previous occupants of the site; all colonization must be from outside the patch. Secondary successions occur when existing communities are disturbed but some at least of their seeds and so on remain. It can be very difficult to pinpoint when a succession reaches a stable climax community, since this may take centuries to achieve and in the meantime further disturbances are likely to occur. The exact nature of the colonization process in an empty patch depends on the size and location of that patch. Many communities are mosaics of patches at different stages in a succession.</p>

<p class="para">No predator–prey, parasite–host, or grazer–plant pair exists in isolation. Each is part of a complex food web including other predators, parasites, food sources, and competitors within the various trophic levels of a community. One of the most common indirect effects of one species on another is a trophic cascade, in which, say, a predator reduces the abundance of a herbivore, thus increasing the abundance of plants.</p>
<p class="para indent">Top-down control of a food web occurs in situations in which the structure (abundance, species number) of lower trophic levels depends on the effects of consumers from higher trophic levels. Bottom-up control occurs in a community dependent on factors, such as nutrient concentration and prey availability, that influence a trophic level from below. The relative importance of these forces varies according to the trophic level under investigation and the number of trophic levels present.</p>
<p class="para indent">Some species are more tightly woven into the food web than others. A species whose removal would produce a significant effect like extinction or a large change in density in at least one other species may be thought of as a strong interactor. Removal of such keystone species leads to significant changes that spread throughout the food web.</p>
<p class="para indent">The relationship between food web complexity and stability is uncertain (and we need to define stability carefully). Mathematical and empirical studies agree in suggesting that, if anything, population stability decreases with complexity, whereas the stability of aggregate properties of whole communities increases with complexity, especially species richness.</p>

<p class="para">An accurate appreciation of the world’s biological diversity is becoming increasingly important. For our conservation efforts to be effective, we must understand why species richness varies widely across the face of the Earth. Why do some communities contain more species than others? Are there patterns or gradients in this biodiversity? If so, what are the reasons for these patterns?</p>

<p class="para">Why does the number of species vary from place to place? And from time to time? These are questions that present themselves not only to ecologists but to anybody who observes and ponders the natural world. They are interesting questions in their own right—but they are also questions of practical importance. If we wish to conserve or restore the planet’s biological diversity, then we must understand how species numbers are determined and how it comes about that they vary. We will see that there are plausible answers to the questions we ask, but these answers are not always clear-cut. This may be disappointing, but it is also a challenge to ecologists of the future. Much of the fascination of ecology lies in the fact that many of the problems are blatant, whereas the solutions can be difficult to find. We will see that a full understanding of patterns in species richness must draw on our knowledge of all the areas of ecology discussed so far in this book.</p>

<p class="para indent">The number of species in a community is referred to as its <span class="txt-italic">species richness</span>. Counting or listing the species present in a community may sound a straightforward procedure, but in practice it is often surprisingly difficult, partly because of taxonomic inadequacies, but also because we can usually count only a proportion of the organisms in an area. The number of species recorded then depends on the number of samples we have taken, or on the volume of the habitat we have explored. The most common species are likely to be represented in the first few samples, and as we take more samples, we begin adding rarer species to the list.</p>
<p class="para indent">At what point do we stop taking further samples? Ideally, we should continue to sample until the number of species stops increasing. For one thing, we can compare the species richness of different communities only if they are based on the same sample sizes, in terms of area of habitat explored, time devoted to sampling, or, best of all, number of individuals included in the samples.</p>

<p class="para indent">When we simply state the number of species present, however, we overlook an important aspect of a community’s structure—namely, that some species are rare and others common. Intuitively, a community of 10 species with equal numbers in each seems more diverse than another with 10 species in which 91% of the individuals belong to the most common species and just 1% to each of the other nine. Yet, each community has the same species richness. <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c10-tdef-0001" title="a mathematical index of species diversity in a community" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - Diversity indices">Diversity indices</span> are measures that combine both species richness and the evenness or equitability of the distribution of individuals among those species (<span id="widget-62958" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62958" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 10.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62958"></div>).

<p class="para">competition and predation may influence species richness</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">We can now consider the relationship between this model and two important kinds of species interactions described in previous chapters: interspecific competition and predation. If a community is dominated by interspecific competition (see <span id="widget-62968" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62968" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 6</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62968"></div>), the resources are likely to be fully exploited. Species richness will then depend on the range of available resources, the extent to which species are specialists, and the permitted extent of niche overlap (<span id="widget-62969" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62969" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a–c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62969"></div></span>). As the chapter proceeds, we will examine a range of influences on each of these three.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Predation, on the other hand, is capable of exerting contrasting effects (see <span id="widget-62970" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62970" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62970"></div>). First, we know that predators can exclude certain prey species; in the absence of these species the community may then be less than fully saturated (<span id="widget-62971" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62971" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3d</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62971"></div></span>), and predation may therefore reduce species richness. On the other hand, predation may tend to keep species below their carrying capacities for much of the time, reducing the intensity and importance of direct interspecific competition for resources. This may then permit much more niche overlap and a <span class="txt-italic">greater</span> richness of species than in a community dominated by competition (<span id="widget-62972" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62972" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62972"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The next two sections examine a variety of factors that influence species richness.

<h1 class="level-1 enum-head txt-orange"><span class="enum">10.2</span> Spatially Varying Factors Influencing Species Richness</h1>
<p class="para">We can subdivide into two separate hypotheses the general idea that spatial (geographic) variations in climate play a critical role in determining species richness. The first is the <span class="txt-bold">productivity hypothesis</span>. This emphasizes the importance of climate in determining productivity at the lowest trophic level – the plants and microbes – and the resources these then provide for herbivores and then carnivores further up the food chain. Of course, we must remember that productivity at a particular location can also be determined by other factors unrelated to climate.</p>
<p class="para indent">We deal with this productivity hypothesis first. The alternative, the <span class="txt-bold">energy hypothesis</span>, emphasizes the direct role of energy (often measured by environmental temperature) on organisms throughout the community. We discuss this hypothesis second.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c10-sec-0005">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Productivity and resource richness</h2>
<p class="para">For plants, the productivity of the environment can depend on whichever nutrient or condition is most limiting to growth (see <span id="widget-62975" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62975" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62975"></div>). Broadly speaking, the productivity of the environment for animals follows the same trends as for plants, mainly as a result of the changes in resource levels at the base of the food chain. If higher productivity is correlated with a wider <span class="txt-italic">range</span> of available resources, then this is likely to lead to an increase in species richness (<span id="widget-62976" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62976" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62976"></div></span>). However, a more productive environment may have a higher rate of supply of resources but not a greater variety of resources. This might lead to more individuals per species, rather than more species.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Again, however, it is possible, even if the overall variety of resources is unaffected, that rare resources in an unproductive environment may become abundant enough in a productive environment for extra species to be added, because more specialized species can be accommodated (<span id="widget-62977" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62977" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62977"></div>). In general, then, there are rather straightforward grounds for expecting that species richness should increase with productivity.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Examples do appear to support this contention (<span id="widget-62978" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62978" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62978"></div>). The species richness of fish in North American lakes, for example, increases with an increase in productivity of the lake’s phytoplankton (<span id="widget-62979" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62979" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.4a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62979"></div></span>). There are also strong positive correlations between species richness and precipitation for both seed-eating ants and seed-eating rodents in the southwestern deserts of the United States (<span id="widget-62980" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62980" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.4b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62980"></div></span>), where it is well established that mean annual precipitation is closely related to plant productivity and thus to the amount of seed resource available. In this latter case, it is particularly noteworthy that in species-rich sites the communities contain more species of very large ants (which consume large seeds) and more species of very small ants (which take small seeds). It seems that either the range of seed sizes is greater in the more productive environments (<span id="widget-62981" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62981" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62981"></div></span>), or the abundance of seeds becomes sufficient to support extra consumer species with narrower niches (<span id="widget-62982" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62982" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62982"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">On the other hand, an increase in diversity with productivity is by no means universal.

<p class="para indent">Indeed, an association between high productivity and low species richness has often been found in plant communities. We also see it where human activities lead to an increased input of nutrient resources like nitrates and phosphates into lakes, rivers, estuaries, and coastal marine regions. When such cultural eutrophication is severe, we consistently see a decline in the species richness of phytoplankton (despite an increase in their productivity). Rosenzweig (1971) referred to such declines as illustrating ‘the paradox of enrichment.’ One possible resolution of the paradox is that high productivity leads to high rates of population growth, bringing about the extinction of some of the species present because of a speedy conclusion to any potential competitive exclusion (see <span id="widget-62986" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62986" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">section 6.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62986"></div>). With lower productivity, the environment is more likely to have changed before competitive exclusion has been achieved.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">It is perhaps not surprising, then, that several studies have demonstrated both an increase and a decrease in richness with increasing productivity – that is, that species richness may be highest at intermediate levels of productivity. Species richness declines at the lowest productivities because of a shortage of resources, but it also declines at the highest productivities where competitive exclusions speed rapidly to their conclusion. We see such humped curves, for instance, when we plot the number of lake phytoplankton species against overall phytoplankton productivity (<span id="widget-62987" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62987" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.6a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62987"></div>) for the same lakes we have already seen in <span id="widget-62988" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62988" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.4a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62988"></div></span>; we see it when we plot the species richness of desert rodents against precipitation (and thus productivity) along a geographic gradient in Israel (<span id="widget-62989" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62989" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.6b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62989"></div></span>), in contrast to the relationship in <span id="widget-62990" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62990" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.4b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62990"></div></span>; and we see it when we plot the diversities of both gastropod and bivalve mollusc species living on the sea floor in deep-sea communities against the level of <span class="txt-bold">particulate organic carbon</span> (POC), the rain of chemical energy falling as dead organic matter from the sea surface (described in <span id="widget-62991" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62991" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 4.5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62991"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Indeed, a number of meta-analyses have been carried out of the wide range of studies of the richness– productivity relationship, from both terrestrial and aquatic systems, in a search for some general rules. These have been heavily criticized for the arguably uncritical way in which the original data sets have been accepted at face value and combined (Whittaker, 2010<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0636">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0636</a>-->) – a problem that besets all such analyses, despite their attractions. Nonetheless, one conclusion that survives such criticism is that a very wide range of relationships has been found: some positive, some negative, some humped, some with no detectable relationship at all, and even some U-shaped curves, cause unknown (<span id="widget-62993" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62993" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62993"></div>).

<p class="para">α-, β-, and γ-diversity</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">We can account for some of this variation among studies simply by assuming that in particular cases, only a proportion of the productivity spectrum was sampled, so that, for example, only the ascending or descending limb of a humped-shaped curve was observed. And where no relationship was observed, the reason may of course be shortcomings in the data collection. But we can make a good case for the nature of the relationship changing, depending on the spatial scale at which it is observed. To make this overall pattern clearer, ecologists have often distinguished between α-, β-, and γ-diversity. Here, <span class="txt-bold">α-diversity</span> refers to diversity at a local scale (<span class="txt-italic">within</span> a community), so it is high when there are many species within each community. Then, <span class="txt-bold">β-diversity</span> refers to the differences among communities within a region, so it is high when different communities in a region differ in the species they contain. Finally, <span class="txt-bold">γ-diversity</span> refers to diversity at the whole regional scale (collections of communities). It therefore combines α- and β-diversity and is highest when both individual communities are diverse and the communities in a region differ.</p>
<p class="para indent">In particular, it has often been suggested that at the local scale, either the relationship between α-diversity declines with productivity or there is a hump-shaped relationship, whereas at the regional scale γ-diversity tends to increase with productivity (Whittaker, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0636">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0636</a>-->). This suggestion is borne out by a study of ponds in southwestern Michigan and northeastern Pennsylvania, where α-diversity focused on the relationship within ponds, while γ-diversity focused on whole watersheds, each of which was a collection of ponds. For both plants and animals, there was a hump-shaped relationship between α-diversity and pond productivity, but γ-diversity increased with the productivity of whole watersheds (<span id="widget-62994" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62994" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.8a, b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62994"></div>). This in turn suggests that the differences between communities within a region (β-diversity) must increase with productivity, and this, too, was borne out by the data (<span id="widget-62995" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62995" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.8c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62995"></div></span>).

<p class="para indent">One plausible, more detailed suggestion is that at the very smallest scales, increased productivity leads to a decline in richness as competition excludes rare species for which there is no space (as in the small quadrats in <span id="widget-62996" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62996" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62996"></div>). At somewhat larger scales (the ponds in <span id="widget-62997" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62997" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62997"></div></span>), there is sufficient space for initial rises in productivity to enhance richness prior to the subsequent decline, and hence the whole hump-shaped relationship is apparent. But at larger scales still (the watersheds in <span id="widget-62998" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_62998" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="62998"></div></span>), species excluded from one community in a region are likely to survive in other, somewhat different communities, such that we observe no decline in richness at higher productivities, and richness simply continues to rise as more exploitable niches become available for the regional species pool. Work in the future will hopefully tell us whether this suggestion is not only plausible but also correct – or indeed, the whole story. Whatever the truth of the matter, the distinction between small, medium, and large scales is certain to differ between different communities – smaller in a grassland, for example, than in a forest. As ever in ecology, we must remember to see the world from the organisms’ point of view.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Energy</h2>
<p class="para">When we turn from productivity to energy, the argument for a direct effect of energy on species richness is essentially a metabolic argument – higher temperatures for longer periods mean more time for species to be active, higher rates of metabolism (more growth, more reproduction, more individuals) and less chance of cold- and frost-damage (Hawkins et al., 2003<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0238">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0238</a>-->).

<p class="para indent">On the other hand, we must be careful, as always, not to mistake association for causation, especially given that energy is itself bound to be one of the drivers of the productivity variations discussed above. We can see, for example, that the species richness of vertebrates in China is also correlated with annual rainfall and with an index of vegetation productivity (<span id="widget-63001" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63001" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.9e, f</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63001"></div>). Is only one of these the true driver of variations in species richness? Or do all three have some part to play?

<p class="para indent">To try to disentangle the separate effects of energy and productivity, each in its own right, Belmaker and Jetz (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0041">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0041</a>-->2011) compiled large data sets on amphibians, birds, and mammals.

<p class="para indent">It is apparent, first, that both energy and productivity retain their associations with species richness even after the other has been taken into account. It is also apparent, though, that the strengths of these relationships are strongly dependent on the scales at which we study them. In particular, the associations for energy were strongest of all at the largest scale, where energy seemed, if anything, to be more important than productivity, whereas at smaller scales, associations with energy were generally much weaker and in some cases nonexistent (<span id="widget-63005" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63005" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.10b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63005"></div>). By contrast, the relationships with productivity were much less sensitive to changes of scale. While they were less strong than the energy relationships at the largest scale, they were not much altered at the local scale (<span id="widget-63006" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63006" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.10b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63006"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Thus, energy, beyond its effects on productivity, seems to have an important role to play in helping us understand patterns of species richness at the global scale. Perhaps it sets an upper limit on richness, regardless of variations in other factors discussed in this chapter. But the role of productivity, as we discussed earlier, reflecting many things other than energy, seems also to be important at a whole range of scales. We should remember, for example, that there are highly species-rich communities at the bottom of the deep oceans (see <span id="widget-63007" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63007" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 4.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63007"></div>) where there is no light and temperatures are low.

Overall, therefore, there may also be a humped relationship between predation intensity and species richness in a community, with greatest richness at intermediate intensities, such as that shown by the effects of cattle grazing (see <span id="widget-63009" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63009" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 7.23</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63009"></div></span>).

These species, together with a sponge and four macroscopic algae (seaweeds), form a typical community on rocky shores of the Pacific coast of North America. Paine removed all starfish from a stretch of shoreline about 8 m long and 2 m wide and continued to exclude them for several years. The structure of the community in nearby control areas remained unchanged during the study, but the removal of <span class="txt-italic">Pisaster</span> had dramatic consequences.</p>
<p class="para indent">Within a few months, the barnacle <span class="txt-italic">Balanus glandula</span> settled successfully. Later mussels (<span class="txt-italic">Mytilus californicus</span>) crowded it out, and eventually the site became dominated by these. All but one of the species of alga disappeared, apparently through lack of space, and the browsers tended to move away, partly because space was limited and partly because there was a lack of suitable food. The main influence of the starfish <span class="txt-italic">Pisaster</span> appears to be to make space available for competitively subordinate species. It cuts a swathe free of barnacles and, most importantly, free of the dominant mussels that would otherwise outcompete other invertebrates and algae. Overall, the natural situation is for there to be predator (starfish)-mediated coexistence, but the removal of starfish led to a reduction in number of species from 15 to eight.</p>

<p class="para">Species-rich meadows are now uncommon in agricultural landscapes in Europe because decades of intensive fertilizer application have allowed a few species to competitively exclude others, a pattern that echoes the results of the remarkable century-long Rothamsted experiment (see <span id="widget-63012" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63012" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63012"></div>). Attempts to restore the lost species richness of these pasture settings are now common. One approach is to use what we know about predator-mediated coexistence or, more generally, exploiter-mediated coexistence. This occurs when one species exploits as food a number of species in the community, reducing the dominance of the most competitively superior species and allowing less competitive species to maintain a foothold.<p></p>

After 2 years, the hemiparasite was found to have suppressed the growth of those plants that it had parasitized, and this led, the following year, to the desired increase in grassland species richness because competitive exclusion had been circumvented (<span id="widget-63013" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63013" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63013"></div>).<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Spatial heterogeneity</h2>
<p class="para">We can expect environments that are more spatially heterogeneous to accommodate extra species because they provide a greater variety of microhabitats, a greater range of microclimates, more types of places to hide from predators, and so on. In effect, the extent of the resource spectrum is increased (see <span id="widget-63015" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63015" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63015"></div>). Confirming this expectation, a study of plant species growing in 51 plots alongside the Hood River, Canada, revealed a positive relationship between species richness and an index of spatial heterogeneity based, among other things, on the number of categories of substrate, slope, drainage regimes, and soil pH present (<span id="widget-63016" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63016" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.13a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63016"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Most studies of spatial heterogeneity, however, have related the species richness of animals to the structural diversity of the plants in their environment.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Environmental harshness</h2>
<p class="para">Environments dominated by an extreme abiotic factor – often called <span class="txt-italic">harsh environments</span> (see <span id="widget-63019" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63019" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 3.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63019"></div>) – are more difficult to recognize than might be immediately apparent. From our own point of view, we might describe as extreme both very cold and very hot habitats, unusually alkaline lakes and grossly polluted rivers. However, species have evolved and live in all such environments, and what is very cold and extreme for us must seem benign and unremarkable to a penguin.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">We might try to get around the problem of defining environmental harshness by letting the organisms decide. Thus, we can classify an environment as extreme if organisms, by their failure to live there, show it to be so. But if the claim is to be made – as it often is – that species richness is lower in extreme environments, then this definition is circular, since it is designed to prove the very claim we wish to test.</p>
<p class="para indent">Perhaps the most reasonable definition of an extreme condition is one that requires, of any organism tolerating it, a morphological structure or biochemical mechanism that is not found in most related species and is costly, either in energetic terms or in terms of the compensatory changes in the organism’s biological processes that are needed to accommodate it. For example, plants living in highly acidic soils (low pH) may be affected directly through injury by hydrogen ions or indirectly via deficiencies in the availability and uptake of important resources such as phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium. In addition, the solubility of aluminium, manganese, and heavy metals may increase to toxic levels. Moreover, the activity of mycorrhizas, enhancing uptake of dissolved nutrients, or bacteria, fixing atmospheric nitrogen (<span class="link">Section 8.4</span>) may be impaired. Plants can tolerate low pH only if they have specific structures or mechanisms allowing them to avoid or counteract these effects.</p>
<p class="para indent">Environments that experience low pHs can thus be considered harsh, and the mean number of plant species recorded per sampling unit in a study in the Alaskan Arctic tundra was indeed lowest in soils of low pH (<span id="widget-63020" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63020" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.14a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63020"></div>).

<p class="para indent">Other extreme environments associated with low species richness include hot springs, caves, and highly saline water bodies such as the Dead Sea. The problem with these examples, however, is that each is also characterized by other features associated with low species richness, such as low productivity and low spatial heterogeneity. In addition, many occupy small areas (caves, hot springs) or areas that are rare compared to other types of habitat (only a small proportion of the streams in southern England are acidic). Hence, we often see extreme environments as small and isolated islands. We will see in <span id="widget-63022" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63022" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 10.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63022"></div> that these features, too, are usually associated with low species richness.

<h1 class="level-1 enum-head txt-orange"><span class="enum">10.3</span> Temporally Varying Factors Influencing Species Richness</h1>
<p class="para">Temporal variation in conditions and resources can be predictable or unpredictable. The distinction is an important one. Predictable variation often occurs on a time scale similar to the generation time of the species in a community themselves. This is the case for seasonal climatic variation, discussed next. The organisms can adapt to such variations, usually by adopting patterns in their own metabolism that parallel the seasonal cycle, while the predictable <span class="txt-italic">absence</span> of seasonal variation may allow specialized adaptation, without the threat of local extinction that a marked change in conditions would provoke. By contrast, unpredictable changes in the habitat are most naturally viewed as a disturbance to a community that changes its composition, following which the community may gradually revert to its pre-disturbance state. We discuss this below.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c10-sec-0012">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Climatic variation and its absence</h2>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c10-feafxd-0006">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">niche differentiation in seasonal and nonseasonal environments</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para">In a predictable, seasonally changing environment, different species may be suited to conditions at different times of the year. We might therefore expect more species to coexist in a seasonal environment than in a completely constant one (see <span id="widget-63023" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63023" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63023"></div>). Different annual plants in temperate regions, for instance, germinate, grow, flower, and produce seeds at different times during a seasonal cycle. Similarly, phytoplankton and zooplankton pass through a seasonal succession in large, temperate lakes, with a variety of species dominating in turn as changing conditions and resources become suitable for each.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">On the other hand, opportunities exist for specialization in a nonseasonal environment that do not exist in a seasonal environment. For example, it would be difficult for a specialist fruit-eater to persist in a seasonal environment when fruit is available for only a very limited portion of the year. But such specialization is found repeatedly in nonseasonal, tropical environments where fruit of one type or another is available continuously.</p>
<p class="para indent">Broadly, studies tend to support the second of these two suggestions – that species richness increases as climatic variation <span class="txt-italic">de</span>creases. For example, as we move along the west coast of North America from Panama in the south to Alaska in the north, we find a significant decrease in the species richness of birds, mammals, and gastropods as the range of monthly mean temperatures steadily increases (MacArthur, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0377">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0377</a>-->). However, this correlation does not of course prove causation, since many other things also change between Panama and Alaska. Thus, there is no established relationship between climatic constancy, as such, and species richness.</p>
<p class="para indent">More supportive, perhaps, is evidence from species-rich biomes in especially unvarying environments, where neither high productivity, nor high energy inputs, nor any of the other factors usually proposed provide a ready explanation. Two examples were described in <span id="widget-63024" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63024" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 4.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63024"></div>. Communities on the abyssal seafloor, 3000–6000m below the sea surface, are characterized by an absence of light and low temperatures (−0.5 − 3.0°C) and dependent for a food resource on detritus falling from the surface communities above. Nonetheless, various studies have reported abyssal sediments containing around 50 different species of polychaete worm for every 150 individuals sampled, 100 nonmicrobial species per 0.25 m<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup>, and frequently very high levels of β-diversity – different species found in different local communities (Smith et al., 2008<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0548">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0548</a>-->). The unvarying nature of these communities, buffered from the fluctuations in the habitats high above them, are likely to have favored both narrow specialization and local speciation.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Similarly, the subtropical oceanic gyres have low productivity but high species richness; a single trawl may bring up 50 different species of fish from their open waters (Barnett, 1983<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0029">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0029</a>-->). The biome, though, is characterized by remarkable spatial and temporal invariance.

<p class="para">the intermediate disturbance hypothesis</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">If we now superimpose the frequency of disturbance on this picture, it seems likely that very frequent disturbances will keep most patches in the early stages of succession (where there are few species), but also that very rare disturbances will allow most patches to become dominated by the best competitors (where there are also few species). This suggests an <span class="txt-bold">intermediate disturbance hypothesis</span>, in which communities are expected to contain most species when the frequency of disturbance is neither too high nor too low (Connell, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0105">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0105</a>-->). The intermediate disturbance hypothesis was originally proposed to account for patterns of richness in tropical rain forests and coral reefs. However, it has become apparent that very many (arguably all) communities are subject to disturbances – the differences being only in their frequencies and intensities, and the sizes of the gaps created. The hypothesis has therefore come to occupy an important place in our attempts to understand patterns in species richness.</p>
<p class="para indent">A number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis. Disturbances in small streams often take the form of bed movements during periods of high discharge, and because stream beds differ in their make up and their flow regimes, some stream communities are disturbed more frequently than others. This variation was assessed in 54 stream sites in the Taieri River in New Zealand. The pattern of richness of macro-invertebrate species conformed to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (<span id="widget-63026" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63026" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.15a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63026"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Another supportive example comes from the plants and animals living on rocky shores in north-central Chile that were subjected, in an experiment, to one of seven disturbance treatments, clearing patches in the experimental plots between zero and twelve times during the course of the experiment (<span id="widget-63027" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63027" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.15b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63027"></div>). Finally, in controlled field experiments, researchers disturbed natural phytoplankton communities in Lake Plußsee (north Germany) at intervals of 2–12 days by disrupting the normal stratification in the water column with bubbles of compressed air. Again, both species richness and Shannon’s diversity index were highest at intermediate frequencies of disturbance (<span id="widget-63028" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63028" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.15c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63028"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Once again, however, we must be careful not to jump from supportive examples to claims that there is a general rule. Surveys, whether of observational or experimental studies, have shown that peaks of richness at intermediate disturbance are far from being a universal finding (<span id="widget-63029" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63029" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.16</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63029"></div>). As with the productivity–richness relationships, a partial explanation may be that only one limb of a humped-shaped curve was sampled. But again, it is also likely that reality is too complex to be captured in one catchall explanation. One particular complication is that as well as disturbance affecting the diversity of a community, the reverse may also be true: diversity can affect the nature and extent of the disturbance. Once we include these reciprocal effects, we can predict a much wider range of richness–disturbance relationships (Hughes et al., 2006).<p></p>

<p class="para">If we consider disturbances acting on much longer timescales, it has also often been suggested that communities may differ in species richness because some are closer to equilibrium and are therefore more saturated than others (see <span id="widget-63030" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63030" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3d</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63030"></div>).

<p class="para indent">It now seems, however, that tropical areas were also disturbed during the ice ages, not directly by ice but by associated climatic changes that saw tropical forest contracting to a limited number of small refuges surrounded by grassland.

Thus, it seems likely that some communities, by virtue of disturbances in their distant past, are less saturated than others. However, it is only rarely that we can pinpoint these communities with confidence.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The relationship between species richness and habitat area is one of the most consistent of all ecological patterns. But is this impoverishment of species on islands more than we would expect in comparably small areas of mainland? Or to look at it the other way round, does the characteristic isolation of islands contribute to their impoverishment of species? These are important questions for an understanding of community structure, since there are many oceanic islands, many lakes, many mountaintops, many woodlands surrounded by fields, many isolated trees, and so on.</p>
<p class="para indent">Probably the most obvious reason why larger areas should contain more species is that larger areas typically encompass more different types of habitat. However, MacArthur and Wilson (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0379">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0379</a>-->), in their <span class="txt-italic">equilibrium theory of island biogeography</span> (<span id="widget-63035" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63035" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 10.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63035"></div>), argued that this explanation was too simple, and that island size and isolation themselves played important roles. They proposed that the number of species on an island is determined by a balance between immigration and extinction; that this balance is dynamic, with species continually going extinct and being replaced (through immigration) by the same or by different species; and that immigration and extinction rates may vary with island size and isolation.<p></p>

<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">MacArthur and Wilson’s Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography</h5>
<p class="para">When Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson published their book <span class="txt-italic">The Theory of Island Biogeography</span> in 1967, they said in their Preface, ‘We do not seriously believe that the particular formulations advanced in the chapters to follow will fit for very long the exacting results of future empirical investigation.’ For a book that has so evidently stood every test that time might reasonably set, this is a remarkably modest and, in a sense, a remarkably inaccurate statement. As they also point out in that Preface, the authors came together as an ecologist (MacArthur) and a taxonomist and zoogeographer (Wilson) but with faith in ‘the ultimate unity of population biology.’ They had faith, too, in the power of general theory. Not the power to be right – to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth – since that is not theory’s purpose (and their ‘particular formulations’ have indeed been found not always to fit the data exactly) – but the power to stimulate thought, stimulate new observations and experiments, and so stimulate further theory as this interplay between data and theory carries our science forward.</p>
<p class="para indent">MacArthur, a Princeton professor, died only five years later, tragically young at 42, having arguably already done more than anyone to establish modern ecology as a synergy between theory and empiricism. E. O. Wilson, who has been at Harvard since 1953, has gone on, among other things, to be dubbed ‘the father of Sociobiology’ following publication of his <span class="txt-italic">Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</span> in 1975 (not without its critics), and to be widely acknowledged as the world’s greatest authority on social insects, especially ants.</p>

<p class="para indent">Their basic theory of island biogeography runs as follows. Taking immigration first, imagine an island that as yet contains no species at all. The rate of immigration of <span class="txt-italic">species</span> will be high, because any colonizing individual represents a species new to that island. However, as the number of resident species rises, the rate of immigration of new, unrepresented species diminishes.

<p class="para indent">The immigration graph is drawn as a curve, because immigration rate is likely to be particularly high when there are low numbers of residents and many of the species with the greatest powers of dispersal are yet to arrive. In fact, the curve should really be a blur rather than a single line, since the precise data will depend on the exact sequence in which species arrive, and this will vary by chance. In this sense, we can think of the immigration curve as the most probable curve.</p>
<p class="para indent">The exact immigration curve will depend on the degree of remoteness of the island from its pool of potential colonizers (<span id="widget-63037" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63037" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.18a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63037"></div>). The curve will always reach zero at the same point (when all members of the pool are resident), but it will generally have higher values on islands close to the source of immigration than on more remote islands, since colonizers have a greater chance of reaching an island the closer it is to the source. It is also likely that immigration rates will generally be higher on a large island than on a small island, since the larger island represents a larger target for the colonizers (<span id="widget-63038" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63038" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.18a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63038"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The rate of species extinction on an island (<span id="widget-63039" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63039" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.18b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63039"></div>) is bound to be zero when there are no species there, and it will generally be low when there are few species. However, as the number of resident species rises, the theory assumes the extinction rate increases. This increase is itself likely to occur at an accelerating rate, since with more species, competitive exclusion becomes more likely, and the population size of each species is on average smaller, making it more vulnerable to chance extinction. Similar reasoning (population sizes will typically be smaller on small islands) suggests that extinction rates should be higher on small than on large islands (<span id="widget-63040" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63040" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.18b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63040"></div></span>).

<p class="para indent">By contrast, a study of a variety of animal groups living on the Lesser Antilles islands in the West Indies partitioned the variation in species richness from island to island into that attributable to island area alone, that attributable to habitat diversity alone, that attributable to correlated variation between area and habitat diversity (and hence not attributable to either alone), and that attributable to neither (<span id="widget-63043" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63043" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.19b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63043"></div>). For reptiles and amphibians, as for the beetles of the Canary Islands, habitat diversity was far more important than island area. But for bats, the reverse was the case, and for birds and butterflies, both area itself and habitat diversity had important roles to play. Overall, therefore, studies like this suggest a separate area effect (larger islands are larger targets for colonization; populations on larger islands have a lower risk of extinction) beyond a simple correlation between area and habitat diversity.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">A more transient but nonetheless important reason for the species impoverishment of islands, especially remote ones, is the fact that many lack species they could potentially support, simply because there has been insufficient time for the species to colonize. An example is the island of Surtsey, which emerged in 1963 as a result of a volcanic eruption. The new island, 40 km southwest of Iceland, was reached by bacteria and fungi, some sea birds, a fly, and seeds of several beach plants within 6 months of the start of the eruption. Its first established vascular plant was recorded in 1965, the first moss colony in 1967, and the first bush (a dwarf willow, <span class="txt-italic">Salix herbacea</span>) in 1998. An earthworm was found in 1993 and slugs in 1998, probably carried in by birds (Hermannsson, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0243">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0243</a>-->).

As in any statistical relationship, we can attribute some variation to either sampling or observer error; data collected from nature are never likely to reflect perfectly the underlying reality. But variation will also arise simply because the observed species richness will have been co-determined by several of the factors we have discussed, and not all of them will vary in parallel with the gradient we are following. So, for example, when we turn next to latitudinal gradients, the question we will ask will be ‘what accounts for the general trend?’ not ‘what accounts for each individual value within the trend?’</p>

<p class="para">One of the most widely recognized patterns in species richness, then, is the increase that occurs from the poles to the tropics.

<p class="para indent">No doubt the most commonly proposed explanations for the latitudinal patterns have been variations in productivity and energy, which, as we discussed in <span id="widget-63052" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63052" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 10.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63052"></div>, may often be difficult to disentangle. It was apparent there, though (see <span id="widget-63053" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63053" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.10</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63053"></div></span>), that variations in energy input, in their own right, are particularly important at global scales, and the latitudinal trends certainly come into that category. Indeed, given what we know about global climatic patterns (<span id="widget-63054" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63054" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63054"></div></span>), it is hard to see why consistent latitudinal trends in productivity would <span class="txt-italic">not</span> be related to energy inputs. Remember, too, also from <span id="widget-63055" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63055" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 10.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63055"></div></span>, that while richness may often peak at intermediate productivities, this is least likely to be observed at larger spatial scales, which again certainly applies to global latitudinal trends.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">We can safely propose, therefore, that the core explanation for the latitudinal gradient in species richness is the underlying variation in energy input, acting directly on metabolism, and the consequences of metabolism at all trophic levels, but acting too through gradients in primary productivity. On the other hand, to repeat the general point made above, this should not blind us to the glaring exceptions to this trend, where richness is no doubt more dependent on factors other than energy input. The high diversity in the low productivity subtropical ocean gyres is a prime example.</p>
<p class="para indent">A number of other explanations have also been put forward for the overall latitudinal trend. Some have pointed out that equatorial regions are generally less seasonal than temperate regions, and this may allow species to be more specialized (that is, to have narrower niches; see <span id="widget-63056" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63056" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63056"></div>). The greater evolutionary age of the tropics has also been proposed as a reason for their greater species richness, and another line of argument suggests that the repeated fragmentation of tropical forest into patches and the subsequent mergers of these promoted genetic differentiation and speciation, accounting for much of the high richness in tropical regions. Each of these answers may contribute to the greater species richness of the tropics; there is no need to imagine that there must be only a single contributory factor.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The richness of tropical communities has also been attributed to a greater intensity of predation and to more specialized predators. More intense predation could reduce the importance of competition, permitting greater niche overlap and promoting higher richness (see <span id="widget-63057" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63057" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63057"></div>). Of course, predation cannot be the root cause of tropical richness, since this assumption simply invites us to ask what gives rise to the richness of the predators themselves. But a focus on predation raises a point we return to later: the various factors acting on a trend may interact with and even reinforce one another. For example, greater energy may lead to higher species richness, to more predation, and hence to even higher species richness.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">At least some of the factors affecting the latitudinal trend in richness are also likely to play a part in explaining altitudinal trends. For example, declines in species richness have often been explained in terms of decreasing productivity associated with lower temperatures and shorter growing seasons at higher altitude, or physiological stress associated with climatic extremes near mountaintops. Indeed, the explanation for the converse, positive relationship between ant diversity and altitude, in <span id="widget-63061" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63061" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.23c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63061"></div>, is that precipitation increased with altitude in this case, resulting in higher productivity at higher altitudes. In addition, high-altitude communities almost invariably occupy smaller areas than lowlands at equivalent latitudes, and they will usually be more isolated from similar communities than lowland sites. Therefore, the effects of area and isolation are likely to contribute to observed decreases in species richness with altitude.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In aquatic environments, the change in species richness with depth shows important similarities to the terrestrial gradient with altitude, but there is also a fundamental difference. With increasing depth in the water column, conditions change but the structural nature of the habitat remains essentially the same. On the bottom, however, the structure of the environment is quite different. The bottom acts, too, as a sink for detritus falling from the communities in the water column above. Thus, in larger lakes, the cold, dark, oxygen-poor abyssal depths contain fewer species than the shallow surface waters, and likewise, in marine habitats, plants and algae are confined to the photic zone (where light penetrates and they can photosynthesize), which rarely extends below 30 m.</p>
<p class="para indent">In the open ocean, though, while there is a rapid decrease in richness with depth, this is markedly reversed on the ocean floor where, as we have noted previously, diversity may be very high. Interestingly, however, in coastal regions, the effect of depth on the species richness of bottom-dwelling animals is to produce not a single gradient, but a peak of richness at about 1000 m, possibly reflecting higher environmental predictability there (<span id="widget-63062" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63062" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.24</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63062"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para">a cascade effect?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Indeed, as with the other gradients in species richness, there is something of a cascade effect with succession: one process that increases richness kick-starts a second, which feeds into a third, and so on. The earliest species will be those that are the best colonizers and the best competitors for open space. They immediately provide resources (and introduce heterogeneities) that were not present before. For example, the earliest plants generate resource depletion zones (see <span id="widget-63067" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63067" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 3.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63067"></div>) in the soil that inevitably increase the spatial heterogeneity of plant nutrients. The plants themselves provide a new variety of microhabitats, and for the animals that might feed on them, they provide a much greater range of food resources (see <span id="widget-63068" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63068" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63068"></div></span>). The increase in herbivory and predation may then feed back to promote further increases in species richness (predator-mediated coexistence, <span id="widget-63069" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63069" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63069"></div></span>), which provides further resources and more heterogeneity, and so on.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In addition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed show much less temporal variation within a forest than in an exposed early successional stage, and the enhanced constancy of the environment may provide a stability of conditions and resources that permits specialist species to build up populations and persist (<span id="widget-63070" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63070" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 10.3b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63070"></div>). Within all gradients of species richness, the interaction of many factors makes it difficult to disentangle cause from effect.

<p class="para">The number of species in a community is referred to as its species richness. Diversity indices are designed to combine species richness and the evenness of the distribution of individuals among those species. We can draw a still more complete picture with a rank–abundance diagram. A simple model can help us understand the determinants of species richness. Within it, a community will contain more species the greater the range of resources, when the species are more specialized in their use of resources, when species overlap to a greater extent in their use of resources, or when the community is more fully saturated.</p>

<p class="para">Species richness often increases with the richness of available resources and productivity, but in many cases too, the reverse has been observed – the paradox of enrichment – and other studies have found species richness to be highest at intermediate levels of productivity. Richness also tends to increase with increases in energy input into a community, acting either directly on organisms’ metabolisms or as one of the factors determining variations in productivity. Predation can exclude certain prey species and reduce richness or permit more niche overlap and thus greater richness (predator-mediated coexistence). Overall, therefore, there may be greatest richness at intermediate intensities.</p>
<p class="para indent">Environments that are more spatially heterogeneous often accommodate extra species because they provide a greater variety of microhabitats, a greater range of microclimates, more types of places to hide from predators, and so on; the resource spectrum is increased. Environments dominated by an extreme abiotic factor are more difficult to recognize than might be immediately apparent. Some apparently harsh environments do support few species, but any overall association has proved extremely difficult to establish.</p>

<p class="para">Seasonally changing environments may allow seasonal specialization and an increase in richness, but opportunities for specialization exist in a nonseasonal environment that are not available in a seasonal environment. On balance, richness seems to be higher in nonseasonal environments. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis suggests that there should be peak richness at intermediate frequencies of disturbance, because very frequent disturbances keep most patches at an early stage of succession (where there are few species), but very rare disturbances allow most patches to become dominated by the best competitors (where there are also few species). Some studies support the hypothesis.</p>
<p class="para indent">Communities may also differ in richness because some are closer to equilibrium and therefore more saturated than others. Hence, the tropics may be rich in species in part because they have existed over long and uninterrupted periods of evolutionary time.</p>

<p class="para">Islands need not be islands of land in a sea of water. The number of species on islands decreases as island area decreases, in part because larger areas typically encompass more different types of habitat. MacArthur and Wilson’s equilibrium theory of island biogeography argues for a separate island effect based on a balance between immigration and extinction, and the theory has received much support. On isolated islands especially, the rate at which new species evolve may be comparable to or even faster than the rate at which they arrive as new colonists.</p>

<p class="para">Richness overall increases from the poles to the tropics, with notable exceptions. Predation, climatic variation, and the greater evolutionary age of the tropics have been put forward as partial explanations, but the key factors are productivity and especially energy input. In terrestrial environments, richness often decreases with altitude (but not always). Factors instrumental in the latitudinal trend are important, but so are area and isolation. In aquatic environments, richness in the water column usually decreases with depth for similar reasons, but the ocean floor communities can be highly diverse. In successions, richness first increases (because of colonization) but eventually decreases (because of competition).</p>

<p class="para">The laws of thermodynamics tell us that the universe is steadily moving towards greater entropy and less order. However, biological systems are sites of localized order maintained by continuous inputs of energy, working against the general trend. All biological entities require this continuous input of energy to support their activities and structure, as well as inputs of matter for their construction. This is true not only for individual organisms, but also for populations, communities, and ecosystems. In this chapter, we explore the intricate interactions of energy and material flows that occur in ecosystems, and the ways in which these flows and their interactions vary across biomes.</p>

<p class="para">The communities and ecosystems across the surface of the planet depend crucially for their energy on the levels of NPP that plants, algae, and other primary producers are able to achieve. NPP is also critical to the global carbon cycle, since it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and interacts strongly with global climate change, as we explore in <span id="widget-63076" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63076" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63076"></div>. Of course, the release of carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere through R<sub class="txt-sub default">het</sub> is also important, and it is the NEP, or the balance between NPP and R<sub class="txt-sub default">het</sub>, that determines the net influence on carbon exchanges of an ecosystem with the atmosphere.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The rate of NPP varies dramatically across the surface of the Earth, both in terrestrial ecosystems and in the oceans (<span id="widget-63077" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63077" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63077"></div>). We see the very highest rates, approaching 800 g C m<sup class="txt-sup default">−2</sup> year<sup class="txt-sup default">−1</sup> and more, in the tropical rain forests. Equally high rates of NPP occur in wetlands, estuaries, and giant kelp beds (see <span id="widget-63078" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63078" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63078"></div></span>), but the spatial area of these ecosystems is too small for them to be apparent in <span id="widget-63079" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63079" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63079"></div></span>.

<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity</h5>
<p class="para">Human activity, particularly from agriculture, has had a remarkable influence on net primary productivity (NPP). One measure of this influence is the ‘human appropriation’ of NPP (Haberl et al., 2007<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0222">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0222</a>-->).</p>
<p class="para indent">Some NPP is directly harvested when agricultural crops are collected and timber is cut from forests. Some of the potential NPP of natural ecosystems is lost due to soil degradation and other land-use changes, including urban and suburban development. And some is lost due to human-caused fires. Cumulatively, almost one-quarter of the potential NPP of the Earth’s terrestrial biomes is lost through this human appropriation. Of that amount, 53% is due to harvest of crops and timber, 40% to lost productivity from land-use changes, and 7% to fires. As Haberl et al. (2007) noted, ‘this is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species!’</p>
<p class="para indent">The pattern of human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP) is far from uniform over the planet (<span id="widget-63083" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63083" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63083"></div>). A large percentage of the potential rate of NPP by natural ecosystems has now been used directly by humans or diminished by human activity in India, much of Europe, the eastern half of the United States, the eastern third of China, southeast Asia, and the seasonal tropical forests of western Africa. Where the natural rate of NPP is low, as in the tundra biomes and many of the major deserts of the world, humans have had little impact. On the other hand, in some major areas of the planet with very high rates of NPP—notably the rain forests of the Amazon in Latin America and the Congo in Africa, as well as much of the savanna region of Africa—humans have until now appropriated less than 20%.<p></p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">Is there any inherent reason it is good or bad for humans to appropriate a quarter of the world’s NPP by terrestrial ecosystems? Would setting a goal of, say, 10% be better? Is there any reason to fear increasing the human appropriation of NPP to 50% or more? What might the consequences be?</span></p>

<p class="para indent">The total potential rate of NPP of the planet’s natural ecosystems (if there were no human disturbance) is estimated to be about 100 petagrams of carbon per year (1 Pg = 10<sup class="txt-sup default">15</sup> g).

Of course, the oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface, so the average rate of NPP per area is higher on land. The single most important biome on the planet in terms of overall NPP is the tropical rain forest, which makes up more than 15% of all NPP globally and more than 30% of terrestrial NPP.

Carbon dioxide is normally present at a level of around 0.03% to 0.04% (300 to 400 ppm) of atmospheric gases and seems to play no significant role in determining differences between the productivities of different communities (although global increases in carbon dioxide concentration may bring big changes; see <span id="widget-63087" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63087" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63087"></div>).

Much of the global pattern of NPP in terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by precipitation patterns and the availability of water, which is controlled in turn by the balance between precipitation and evaporation.<p></p>

First, temperature has a direct effect on the physiological processes of photosynthesis, which tends to lead to higher rates of NPP as temperature increases. The ecological effect of this increase is relatively small, though, and is dwarfed by the other two factors. The second factor is the relationship between temperature and evaporation: evaporation increases greatly with increased temperature, and this can lead to lower water availability to plants, greatly reducing NPP. And third, the rate of decomposition of dead organic matter increases as temperature rises. Decomposition leads to release of inorganic nutrients, so higher rates of decomposition result in a higher rate of release of nutrients, providing a greater supply to plants, which in turn can increase rates of NPP.

We now call this idea “Liebig’s Law of the Minimum.” (Source: <span id="widget-63099" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63099" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63099"></div></span>)</span>

<p class="para">Justin von Liebig was one of the leading chemists of the 19th century. He became a professor at the University of Giessen in Germany when he was only 21 years old in 1824 (<span id="widget-63100" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63100" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63100"></div>), spending half of his 50-year career there before moving to the University of Munich. He edited the leading German chemical science journal of his time and played a large role in the development of the modern method of laboratory-based instruction in chemistry that is still widely used to this day.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Although a chemist, Liebig also had an enduring influence on ecology. In 1816, when he was only13 years old, a massive volcanic eruption led to the ‘year without a summer.’ The resulting global famine hit Germany particularly hard and undoubtedly precipitated Liebig’s life-long interest in using science to improve agriculture and to understand the growth of plants. From an ecological standpoint, his most important discovery was that plants ‘feed’ on inorganic nitrogen compounds in soils and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to create new organic tissue. His work led eventually to the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture, and he recognized that nitrogen is more important to agricultural crop growth than any other nutrient. The massive explosion in agricultural productivity over the past 150 years—an increase that is absolutely necessary to support the current human population—resulted in large part from this recognition.</p>
<p class="para indent">Liebig’s Law of the Minimum states that the growth of a plant is limited primarily by the one nutrient that is in relatively short supply—relative, that is, to the needs of the plant. This concept remains important in ecological thought in the 21st century.</p>

<p class="para indent">A recent global model (Wang et al., 2012) predicts the spatial patterning of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation across the natural terrestrial biosphere by estimating, for both nutrients, the rate of supply, and the potential demand to support NPP as a function of climate, vegetation type, and soil type (<span id="widget-63101" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63101" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.8</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63101"></div>). According to this model, either limitation by nitrogen or colimitation by nitrogen and phosphorus is likely in most temperate grasslands and forests, phosphorus alone is more critical in many tropical forests and savannas, and nitrogen alone is the more limiting nutrient in deserts, tundra systems, and boreal forests. This nutrient limitation depresses the rate of NPP by up to 20% in the phosphorus-limited ecosystems, and by up to 40% in the nitrogen-limited ecosystems.<p></p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">The model predictions of Wang et al. (2010) agree with a large amount of data on nutrient limitation in terrestrial ecosystems collected from across the Earth, and indeed phosphorus limitation is very common in tropical forests. This limitation results at least in part from a very low availability of phosphorus in the old, heavily weathered soils that dominate much of the tropics. Relatively young soils formed from recent weathering of bedrock often contain high levels of available phosphorus, but over geological time scales, weathering leads to less available phosphorus as it is leached away or bound in unavailable mineral forms. The older soils are far more prevalent in the tropics, which have not seen any glacial activity for millions of years.</p>
<p class="para indent">The importance of soil age on nutrient limitation in tropical forests was well demonstrated by experimentally fertilizing forests at three different sites in Hawaii (<span id="widget-63102" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63102" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.9</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63102"></div>). All the Hawaiian Islands were formed from volcanoes and from the same magma source, so they all have the same type of bedrock. The oldest are more than 4 million years old, while on the youngest island volcanoes are still active, and new rock is still being continuously formed. The islands all have the same climate, so they provide an ideal site for studying just the effect of soil age. Ecosystems with young soils (300 years) were nitrogen limited, while those on old soils (4.1 million years) were phosphorus limited. The tropical forest ecosystem on soils of intermediate age (20 thousand years) were colimited by nitrogen and phosphorus.<p></p>

At one extreme, NPP in the subtropical ocean gyres is extremely low, even though light penetration through the water column is high, because the nutrient concentrations and rate of nutrient inputs are so low. On the other hand, NPP in upwelling ecosystems is high because the upward-moving water provides a high concentration of nutrients and also keeps the phytoplankton buoyed in the light-rich surface layers.<p></p>

<p class="para">nutrients are a greater control on NPP in aquatic systems than on land</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Why do nutrients play a greater role in regulating NPP in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ones? The reason lies in the huge difference between the relative proportions of nitrogen and phosphorus on the one hand and of the major elements—carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen—on the other in the biomass of the primary producers. The proportion of these latter three elements in biomass is relatively constant, driven in part by the molar ratio that characterizes carbohydrates—one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom—and ecologists tend to focus just on carbon. On the other hand, the relative amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus vary tremendously.</p>
<p class="para indent">For instance, while the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in most marine phytoplankton is approximately 7:1, the ratio in many grasses is 35:1 or more, and for trees 600:1 or more (<span id="widget-63109" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63109" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63109"></div>). These differences are driven by the fact that structural material is important in land plants but not in algae and cyanobacteria. The marine phytoplankton are composed largely of the essential materials for life and photosynthesis, including chlorophyll and enzyme systems, and these materials are rich in nitrogen (and phosphorus). The chloroplasts of tree and grass leaves are similar in composition to the phytoplankton, but whole trees are made up largely of wood, a necessity as they as reach up into the sky to compete with their neighbors for light. The cellulose and lignin of wood contain very little nitrogen. Even the leaves of trees and grasses contain more structural carbon than do marine phytoplankton, since the air around them provides far less support to tissues than does the water of lakes and oceans. The relationship between the abundances of elements in organisms is called <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c11-tdef-0002" title="the science concerned with mass balance of chemical elements as they move through food webs" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - stoichiometry">stoichiometry</span>, a topic we will consider in more detail when we examine the relative importance of nutrients in different aquatic ecosystems below.<p></p>

<p class="para">A long-time professor at Harvard University and one of the first research scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on the Massachusetts coast, Alfred Redfield was among the great marine ecologists and biogeochemists of the 20th century (<span id="widget-63113" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63113" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63113"></div>). Originally trained as an animal physiologist, he was fascinated by large-scale patterns in ocean chemistry and how these related to the controls on primary production in the oceans.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">By early in the 20th century, marine chemists had documented that the ratio of dissolved nitrogen to phosphorus throughout much of the ocean was relatively fixed at 15:1 (by moles). The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in the tissues of marine phytoplankton is also 15:1, and Redfield’s creative mind looked for a connection. His hypothesis, developed in a set of papers during the 1930s and 1950s (he spent the 1940s on research related to supporting Allied efforts in World War II), was that the stoichiometric ratio in the phytoplankton is determined by the basic chemical constituents of the machinery necessary for life for a phytoplankton cell, the relative amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in cell membranes, chlorophyll, enzymes, DNA, etc. Over geological time scales, the ratio of dissolved nutrients in the oceans came to reflect this same ratio, due to biogeochemical feedbacks.</p>
<p class="para indent">Redfield argued that phytoplankton must take up the dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the same 15:1 ratio as in their cellular chemistry. If nitrogen were in short supply (that is, available at ratios less than 15:1), then nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria would respond and create more biologically available nitrogen from the massive supply of molecular N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> dissolved in seawater. As phytoplankton died and were recycled, this would gradually build up the amount of ‘fixed’ inorganic nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium) in the oceans. On the other hand, Redfield concluded, if the ratio of inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus in the oceans were greater than 15:1 for any substantial period of time (geologically speaking), bacteria that convert nitrate to molecular N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> (‘denitrifying’ bacteria) would gradually consume the excess biologically available nitrogen.</p>
<p class="para indent">In this model view of the world’s oceans, phosphorus is the nutrient that ultimately limits primary productivity. The availability of phosphorus, in turn, is regulated by its inputs from land and by its interaction with the sediments of the deep ocean. The amount of biologically available inorganic nitrogen roughly balances the needs of the phytoplankton—relative to phosphorus—and is regulated by the balance between nitrogen fixation and the work of the denitrifying bacteria. In broad brush, Redfield’s model remains the way that marine scientists view the ecology and biogeochemistry of the oceans to this day, and it has played a huge role in the way freshwater and terrestrial ecologists think as well.</p>
</section></div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">At any particular time and place, either nitrogen or phosphorus may be in slightly lower supply relative to the needs of the phytoplankton, and therefore slightly more limiting to NPP. But this is a transient feature, with nitrogen and phosphorus being equally important in limiting production in the gyres over periods from years to decades and longer. The very small input of deep-ocean nutrients to the surface waters of the subtropical gyres has an N:P ratio that is also very close to the Redfield ratio of 15:1. This largely explains the colimitation by nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>

<p class="para">phosphorus is limiting in many lakes …</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In a large number of lakes, particularly in the temperate zone, NPP is tightly controlled by the phosphorus supply. When the input of phosphorus is greater, the concentration of phosphorus and rates of NPP are also greater (see <span id="widget-63114" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63114" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.11</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63114"></div>). Excess inputs of phosphorus can lead to great ecological damage, including waters depleted of oxygen by ‘blooms’ of primary producers. These waters cannot support animal life (particularly in the bottom waters of stratified lakes), and there is a loss of biodiversity. This process of excess nutrient enrichment, called <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c11-tdef-0003" title="enrichment of a water body with plant nutrients; usually resulting in a community dominated by phytoplankton" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - eutrophication">eutrophication</span>, accelerated greatly in the 1950s and 1960s across much of North America and Europe. The whole-lake ecosystem experiments by scientists at Canada’s Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), described in <span id="widget-63115" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63115" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63115"></div></span>, established that phosphorus was the central culprit in lake eutrophication. Since the early 1970s, developed countries have worked hard to reduce excess phosphorus inputs, although challenges remain and phosphorus pollution has also become a problem in the developing world.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The experiments at ELA explicitly used Redfield’s ocean model (see <span id="widget-63116" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63116" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 11.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63116"></div>) as a way to understand lakes. When lakes were fertilized with phosphorus and nitrogen was abundant, NPP was clearly tied to the phosphorus inputs. But the ELA scientists wanted to know what would happen if nitrogen were in relatively scarce supply. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria were not observed in the ELA lakes when nitrogen was plentiful, but when the nitrogen fertilization to a lake was cut—while keeping the phosphorus fertilization level high so the inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fell below the Redfield ratio of 15:1—nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria appeared in a matter of weeks (<span id="widget-63117" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63117" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Table 11.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63117"></div></span>). These came to dominate the phytoplankton community and fixed sufficient nitrogen to balance its relative deficit compared to phosphorus and maintain phosphorus limitation of the lake. Thus, in these lake experiments, the feedbacks that led to increased nitrogen fixation occurred on the time scales of weeks, much faster than the time scale that may balance nitrogen and phosphorus in the oceans.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Efforts by governments to reduce phosphorus inputs to lakes had an immediate, demonstrable effect in improving water quality in the 1970s, on the Great Lakes of North America and on many smaller lakes in the United States, Canada, and Europe. This is one of the great success stories of ecological research leading to immediate benefit in better environmental management. But eutrophication in estuaries and coastal waters continued to worsen for several more decades (see <span id="widget-63118" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63118" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 1.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63118"></div>).

<p class="para indent">Many factors make nitrogen limitation more likely in estuaries than in lakes. One of these is the interaction of estuaries with coastal waters: while almost all the nutrient inputs to lakes come from upstream watershed sources, estuaries also receive nutrients from the coastal waters (as we discuss below in <span id="widget-63120" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63120" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 11.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63120"></div>). These coastal waters are often relatively depleted in nitrogen compared to phosphorus, so they can serve as a rich source of phosphorus to estuaries, making phosphorus limitation less likely. Another important difference is the lack of nitrogen fixation by planktonic cyanobacteria in most estuaries. When nitrogen deficits start to develop in lakes, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria begin to make up this deficit, but no such response occurs in estuaries except at very low (almost lake-like) salinities.<p></p>

<p class="para">why is there so little nitrogen fixation by phytoplankton in estuaries?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Microbiologists and ecologists have been fascinated by this dichotomy for decades and have proposed and tested many hypotheses to explain the pattern. Simple physiological explanations have proven insufficient. It turns out that the absence of the nitrogen fixers in estuaries results from an interaction of a physiological constraint and grazing by zooplankton. The physiological constraint comes from the very high concentrations of sulfate in seawater, which interferes with and slows the uptake of molybdenum, an element essential for nitrogen fixation. The resulting slow growth of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria makes them very vulnerable to grazing.</p>
<p class="para indent">This interaction was first tested in a model in the late 1990s (<span id="widget-63121" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63121" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.16</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63121"></div>). In the model, nitrogen fixation is a function of the population size of the planktonic cyanobacteria under conditions when the ratio of available N:P is low. The population size, then, is controlled by the balance between the growth rate and death rate of the cyanobacteria. Death is through zooplankton grazing, and growth is controlled by the phosphorus and nitrogen supply; the nitrogen supply in turn is a function of both the environmental supply and the rate of nitrogen fixation. This results in a positive feedback, where high growth leading to a high cyanobacteria population size further increases the growth rate. The ultimate growth rate is constrained by phosphorus.<p></p>

In a subsequent experiment (1998), a very small population of cyanobacteria grew in even in the presence of zooplankton, but the population was significantly larger when zooplankton were suppressed. Even these populations were some 10-fold lower than observed in the ELA freshwater lake experiments, though. This was not simply an artifact of the mesocosm tanks: in the same tanks in a freshwater experiment with no zooplankton grazing, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria were almost 30 times higher than in the estuarine experiment and 3 to 5 times higher than in the ELA experiment (Marino et al., 2006<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0386">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0386</a>-->).<p></p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">If grazing by zooplankton in estuaries can interact with the sulfate-induced slow growth rate of planktonic cyanobacteria to prevent significant rates of nitrogen fixation, how can we explain the reasonably high rates of planktonic nitrogen fixation in the subtropical ocean gyres? Presumably the sulfate there also leads to a slow growth rate of the cyanobacteria. The most reasonable hypothesis is that these cyanobacteria do indeed grow slowly, but that slow growth per se does not prevent the eventual establishment of a significant population of cyanobacteria and resulting nitrogen fixation. It is the grazing in estuaries that makes the slow growth problematic. This grazing is by generalist species of zooplankton that are primarily feeding on other species of phytoplankton of similar size as—and far more abundant than—the cyanobacteria. In the subtropical gyres, most phytoplankton are far smaller than the cyanobacteria (see <span id="widget-63127" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63127" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 4.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63127"></div>), and there are no generalist zooplankton that feed on phytoplankton that are as large as the cyanobacteria.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">While nitrogen and phosphorus are the nutrients most limiting to NPP in most of the world’s oceans, iron is more limiting over some 20% of these waters. In these areas, which include much of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica as well as the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean, inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus are abundant, yet NPP and phytoplankton populations are low (Lalli &amp; Parson, 2004<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0336">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0336</a>-->). For many decades, marine ecologists thought the low phytoplankton biomass resulted from very high grazing on them, but in the late 1980s it became apparent that these areas have unusually low iron levels (Martin &amp; Fitzwater, 1988<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0389">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0389</a>-->). This idea was controversial, and it became even more so when Martin proposed to artificially fertilize the oceans with iron to increase productivity and draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a way to help mitigate global warming (<span id="widget-63128" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63128" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 11.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63128"></div>).

Can the oceans be managed so as to increase this uptake and partially mitigate global warming?

<p class="para indent">From the very start, this idea has drawn strong reactions. Some environmental organizations are appalled at the idea of such a large-scale manipulation of otherwise pristine ocean waters, and many scientists have cautioned that there might be unanticipated consequences such as harmful algal blooms, depletion of oxygen in deep-ocean waters, and release of sulfur-containing gases to the atmosphere. On the other hand, several commercial companies have explored the idea as a way of creating marketable carbon credits to sell in the European Union and those countries with established markets for credits for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="para indent">The controversy erupted in 2012 after a U.S. business executive working with a native village fertilized the coastal Pacific Ocean waters some 300 km west of Canada with 100 tons of iron sulfate (<span id="widget-63130" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63130" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.18</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63130"></div>).

First, not all the primary producer biomass produced (plant, algal, and so on) is consumed alive by herbivores.

Second, not all the plant biomass eaten by herbivores (nor all the herbivore biomass eaten by carnivores) is assimilated and available for incorporation into consumer biomass. Some is lost in feces, and this also passes to the decomposers. Third, not all the energy that has been assimilated is actually converted to biomass. A proportion is lost as respiratory heat. This occurs both because no energy conversion process is 100% efficient (some energy is lost as unusable random heat, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics), and also because the organisms do work that requires energy, again released as heat.

Here, what remains of the joule may be assimilated by a fungus and consumed by a soil mite, which uses it to do work, dissipating a further part of the joule as heat. At each consumption step, the rest of the joule may fail to be assimilated and pass in the feces to dead organic matter, or it may be assimilated and respired, or assimilated and incorporated into growth of body tissue (or the production of offspring). The body may die and what remains of the joule enters the dead organic matter compartment, or it may be captured alive by a consumer in the next trophic level where it meets a further set of possible branching pathways. Ultimately we see that each joule will have found its way out of the ecosystem, dissipated as respiratory heat at one or more of the transitions in its path along the food chain.

Bacteria and fungi digest dead organic matter externally and, between them, typically absorb almost all the product: they are often said to have AEs of 100%. AEs are typically low for terrestrial herbivores, detritivores, and microbivores (20–50%), somewhat higher for aquatic herbivores, and high for carnivores (around 80% and sometimes higher). The way plants allocate production to roots, wood, leaves, seeds, and fruits also influences their usefulness to herbivores. Seeds and fruits may be assimilated with efficiencies as high as 60–70% and leaves with about 50% efficiency, while the AE for wood may be as low as 15%.</p>

<p class="para indent">The overall <span class="txt-bold">trophic transfer efficiency</span> from one trophic level to the next is simply CE × AE × PE. This represents the percentage of energy (or organic matter) at one trophic level that is transferred to the next. This concept originated with the pioneering work of Raymond Lindeman in 1942, and for many decades after that, it was generally assumed that trophic transfer efficiencies were around 10%. Indeed, some ecologists referred to a 10% ‘law.’ However, there is certainly no law of nature that results in precisely one-tenth of the energy that enters a trophic level transferring to the next. Consider a zebra grazing on grass in a savanna ecosystem. As noted above, CE for herbivores in grasslands is commonly 25%; AE for a herbivore on grass is fairly low, perhaps is in the range of 20%; and PE for an endotherm such as a zebra is in the range of 3%. Therefore, CE × AE × PE = 0.15%, or two orders of magnitude less than 10%. The transfer efficiency from zebra to lion is somewhat greater, but still far below 10%, due to the low PE for endotherms. Even with high values for CE (80%) and AE (80%), the trophic transfer efficiency from the zebra to the lion is in the range of only 1%.</p>

These higher-level transfers would include invertebrate carnivores (carnivorous zooplankton) eating invertebrates (herbivorous zooplankton), vertebrate carnivores (fish) eating invertebrates (zooplankton), and vertebrate carnivores (fish) eating other vertebrates (fish). Given that AE for these carnivores is in the range of 80%, and that PE is in the range of 40% for invertebrates and 10% for fish, CE must be in the range of 25% of the invertebrates and 100% for the fish—values that are at the extremes listed above for carnivores.

<p class="para indent">When we view them in terms of carbon (energy), the tropical forest and estuary are the most productive, and the subtropical gyre looks like a desert. However, when we think in terms of nitrogen (protein), the rate of production is very similar in the tropical forest, grassland, and subtropical gyre, while the rate is very much greater in the estuary. This reflects the high C:N ratio for the trees in the forest, with much of the production going into structural production of wood, an intermediate ratio for the grasses, and a low ratio for phytoplankton in the subtropical gyre and estuary (see <span id="widget-63142" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63142" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63142"></div>). From the viewpoint of protein production, the reason for the higher trophic transfer efficiencies in the aquatic ecosystems becomes very clear: it is easier for an herbivore to produce its new protein by eating a protein-rich diet. This also helps us to understand why production of top predators can be as high as it is in the subtropical gyres, even though from the standpoint of carbon NPP they look like deserts. These subtropical gyres are highly efficient protein machines.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Note that some immobilization can occur during decomposition, for instance when a microbe growing on a dead leaf with a high C:N ratio incorporates inorganic nitrogen from the environment into its tissue, which becomes part of the organic nitrogen of the leaf-microbe detritus. In the end, though, decomposition culminates with complex, energy-rich molecules being broken down by their consumers (decomposers and detritivores) into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic nutrients. Ultimately, the incorporation of solar energy in photosynthesis, and the immobilization of inorganic nutrients into biomass, is balanced by the loss of energy and organic nutrients when the organic matter is mineralized.</p>
<p class="para indent">If a scavenging animal, a vulture, or a burying beetle, perhaps, does not take a dead resource immediately, the process of decomposition usually starts with colonization by bacteria, archaea, and fungi. Spores for these organisms are always present in the air and the water and are usually on (and often in) organic material before it is dead. The early colonists tend to use soluble materials, mainly amino acids and sugars that are freely diffusible. The residual resources, though, are not diffusible and are more resistant to attack. Subsequent decomposition therefore proceeds more slowly, aided by microbial specialists that can break down structural carbohydrates such as celluloses, lignins, and complex proteins such as suberin (cork) and insect cuticle.</p>

In Australia, for example, during the past 200 years, the cow population increased from just seven individuals (brought over by the first English colonists in 1788) to 30 million or so, producing 300 million cowpats per day. The lack of native dung beetles led to losses of up to 2.5 million hectares per year under dung.

<p class="para">Chemical elements and compounds are vital for the processes of life. When living organisms expend energy (as they all do, continually), they do so, essentially, in order to extract chemicals from their environment and hold on to and use them for a period before they lose them again. Thus, the activities of organisms profoundly influence the patterns of flux of chemical matter. In this section, we focus on the flux of a few elements—carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus—at the scale of the ecosystem. We focus on carbon because it is such a major component of all biomass, and we focus on nitrogen and phosphorus since their availabilities are so important in regulating NPP across much of the Earth. It is the cycling of these nutrient elements through and within ecosystems that determines their biological availability. (We discuss the global cycles of these elements in <span id="widget-63151" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63151" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63151"></div>.)<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The great bulk of living matter is water. The rest is made up mainly of carbon compounds, and this is the form in which energy is accumulated and stored. Carbon enters the food web of a community when a simple molecule, carbon dioxide, is taken up in photosynthesis. Once incorporated through NPP, it is available for consumption as part of a sugar, a fat, a protein, or, very often, a cellulose molecule. It follows exactly the same route as energy, being successively consumed and either defecated, assimilated, or used in metabolism, during which the energy of its molecule is dissipated as heat while the carbon is released to the atmosphere again as carbon dioxide. Here, though, the tight link between energy and carbon ends.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Once energy has been transformed into heat, it can no longer be used by living organisms to do work or to fuel the synthesis of biomass. The heat is eventually lost to the universe and can never be recycled: life on Earth is possible only because a fresh supply of solar energy is made available every day. In contrast, the carbon in carbon dioxide can be used again in photosynthesis. Carbon and nutrient elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, and others are available to primary producers as simple inorganic molecules and ions (carbon dioxide, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate) in the atmosphere, soils, or water. Each is assimilated and incorporated into complex organic compounds in biomass during primary production. Ultimately, however, when the organic compounds are metabolized to carbon dioxide, the nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients are released to the environment again in simple inorganic form. Another primary producer may then assimilate them, and so an individual atom of a nutrient element may pass repeatedly through one food chain after another. This continued uptake and release is termed <span class="txt-italic">recycling</span>.</p>
<p class="para indent">Unlike the energy of solar radiation, nutrients and carbon dioxide are present on the Earth in a finite amount. As they are incorporated into the organic matter of biomass, they are no longer available to other primary producers until the biomass has decomposed and the nutrients have been mineralized. For many of the elements in living matter, such as sodium, potassium, chlorine, and sulfur, the amount tied up in living biomass and organic detritus is quite small relative to the supply in virtually all ecosystems on Earth. On the other hand, the amount of phosphorus in living biomass and detritus is large relative to the inorganic supply in many ecosystems, which is why phosphorus can commonly limit NPP. Recycling of phosphorus is very important to continued primary production in such ecosystems.</p>

<p class="para indent">The nitrogen cycle is dominated by a variety of bacterially mediated processes—in fact, even more than the main ones described above. The interaction of the nitrogen cycle with geology is limited, and nitrogen is found as a component of rock only in sedimentary rocks formed from ancient sediments rich in organic detritus. On the other hand, the phosphorus cycle is more geologically determined and is far less mediated by bacterial processes. Many types of rocks contain phosphorus, though generally in only trace amounts, and the weathering of the rock—its gradual conversion over geological time scales to soils—frees this and starts the biological phosphorus cycle. Inorganic phosphate ions are the only biologically available form of phosphorus, and it is this form that primary producers assimilate into their biomass. As organic matter is consumed or decomposed, the organic phosphorus is mineralized back to inorganic phosphate ions. The phosphate can be strongly adsorbed onto soil and sediment particles, and it can indeed be precipitated into new minerals such as apatite (a mineral that contains calcium as well as phosphorus and over other elements) that form in some sediments and soils. Note that the bones and teeth of vertebrate animals are also composed of phosphorus-rich apatite.</p>

The ecosystem scale is particularly appropriate for evaluating the factors that regulate the availability of nutrients to primary producers, and for understanding the interactions of different element cycles. Nutrients cycle within the ecosystem but also move across the boundaries of the ecosystem, primarily via exchanges with the atmosphere and fluxes in flowing water. Nutrients can also enter the ecosystem through weathering of the rocks and soil within the ecosystem.<p></p>

The subtropical ocean gyres represent ecosystems that are tightly closed: for every new atom of nitrogen or phosphorus that enters the surface waters of the gyre from the small mixing of nutrient-rich deep-ocean waters from below or from the atmosphere, perhaps 50 to 100 atoms of nitrogen and phosphorus are recycled within the gyre and assimilated by phytoplankton during NPP. At the other extreme, for heavily fertilized agricultural ecosystems or coastal salt marshes that have high rates of exchange of water with adjacent estuaries through tidal action, the external supply of nitrogen may match or even exceed the rate of recycling within the ecosystem, and is often sufficient on its own to support NPP.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Weathering of parent bedrock and soil, by both physical and chemical processes, is the main source of nutrients such as calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium in many terrestrial ecosystems, which may then be taken up via the roots of plants. Plants themselves can further this process, at the extreme by growing roots into fractures in the rock to make more cracks (<span id="widget-63162" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63162" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.28</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63162"></div>). Plants further weather in more subtle ways as well, for example, by secreting organic acids that can help solubilize minerals. An accumulation of carbon dioxide in soils from respiration also contributes to the acidity and often accelerates weathering. Weathering is particularly important on young soils, such as those created by volcanic action in the past few tens of thousands of years or those glaciated in the last Ice Age. Older soils that may have been weathered for millions of years are very limited in their ability to provide further inputs of nutrients from further weathering.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Most bedrocks have little if any nitrogen in them, so weathering is seldom an important source of nitrogen in terrestrial systems. Rather, the major sources are nitrogen fixation and atmospheric inputs in dryfall and wetfall. For nitrogen, dryfall includes not only the nitrogen that settles in particles but also the uptake by vegetation and other moist surfaces of reactive nitrogen gases, such as ammonia and nitric acid vapor. These inputs are particularly important downstream of major pollution sources to the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="para indent">Some very low rate of nitrogen fixation by free-living cyanobacteria occurs in many ecosystems, but this is seldom a major input to the ecosystem. On the other hand, nitrogen fixation can be very important in tropical rainforests, with fixation both by heterotrophic bacteria that are symbionts associated with tree roots, and by cyanobacteria associated with lichens in the forest canopy.

</aside>
<p class="para indent">Nutrients can circulate within the ecosystem for many years, or a nutrient atom can pass through the system in a matter of minutes, perhaps without interacting with the biota at all. Whatever the case, the atom will eventually be lost through one of the variety of processes that remove nutrients from the system. These processes constitute the debit side of the nutrient budget equation. The rate of loss is greater in more open ecosystems.</p>
<p class="para indent">Release to the atmosphere is one pathway of nutrient loss. Nitrogen may be lost as N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub>, in ecosystems where low-oxygen environments encourage denitrification. Some nitrogen can also be lost as N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub>O, both through denitrification and nitrification. Further, ammonia gas is released during the decomposition of vertebrate excreta. Other pathways of nutrient loss are important in particular instances. For example, fire (either natural, or when, for instance, agricultural practice includes the burning of stubble) can volatilize large amounts of both nitrogen and sulfur gases to the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="para indent">For many elements in many ecosystems, the most substantial pathway of loss is in streamflow. The water that drains from the soil of a terrestrial ecosystem into a stream carries a load of nutrients that is partly dissolved and partly particulate. Phosphorus and iron tend to move largely attached to particles, so losses are related to the overall rate of erosion of soils. Nitrogen, on the other hand, is usually lost primarily as dissolved forms (both nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen compounds) in flowing water.</p>
<p class="para indent">Vegetation can have a pronounced influence on the retention or loss of nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems, as we introduced in <span id="widget-63165" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63165" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63165"></div> (see <span id="widget-63166" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63166" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63166"></div></span>). When the forests in a catchment were cut in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, the export of nitrate increased more than 100-fold compared to uncut reference catchments (see <span id="widget-63167" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63167" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.12</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63167"></div></span>). Losses of potassium and calcium also increased, though less dramatically. Trees and other vegetation help retain nutrients in an ecosystem through two mechanisms. First, they transpire water and thereby reduce the water flow downstream that carries dissolved substances with it and that erodes the soil; second, they take up the nutrients that are being rapidly mineralized by bacteria and other heterotrophs so they are not available to be carried away to the stream water. When undisturbed, forest ecosystems tend to be closed ecosystems with regard to nutrient cycling, but they become very open systems when cut or otherwise disturbed, such as through fire or wind damage.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Estuaries, where rivers meet the coastal ocean, are like lakes in many ways, receiving nutrients both from upstream ecosystems and from the atmosphere. Unlike lakes, however, estuaries also receive nutrients from downstream, from the coastal ocean waters. Estuaries grade from freshwater at one end to the full salinity of seawater at the other. The mixing that creates this gradient can actually pull salty seawater up into the estuary, particularly along the bottom, in what is called reverse estuarine flow. This salty water carries along with it the nutrients that are in the coastal ocean waters. These inputs can be substantial, particularly for phosphorus. For example, Chesapeake Bay—the largest estuary in the United States and one of the most sensitive to nutrient pollution—gets 25% of its phosphorus inputs but less than 1% of its nitrogen inputs from the coastal ocean.</p>

The relative importance of these sources is determined by the physics on the continental shelf in the local area, by the amount of nutrients flowing down rivers in that area, and by the amount of atmospheric pollution from the upstream land sources in the area. Both the northeastern coast of the United States (the continental shelf from Maine south to Virginia) and the North Sea (between the United Kingdom and mainland Europe) receive a substantial amount of nitrogen from deep-ocean waters, while the Gulf of Mexico is more isolated from the influence of the deep ocean. On the other hand, the Gulf of Mexico receives a very large amount of nitrogen from terrestrial sources, particularly from the Mississippi River, which drains over 40% of the lower 48 states of the United States, including the Midwestern corn belt. The North Sea also receives substantial nitrogen from terrestrial sources; its watersheds are smaller than for the Gulf of Mexico, but human activity is intense in those watersheds. The terrestrial inputs to the continental shelf off the northeastern United States are smaller, despite a great deal of human activity, because the watershed area is so much less than for the Gulf of Mexico; when expressed per area of watershed, the fluxes from watersheds are actually higher in the northeastern United States than for the Mississippi River basin (<span id="widget-63172" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63172" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63172"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para">The pattern of net primary productivity in both terrestrial ecosystems and the oceans varies dramatically across the Earth. Slightly more than half of all net primary productivity on the planet occurs in terrestrial ecosystems and slightly less than half in the oceans. Net primary productivity per area is at its highest in tropical rain forests, some wetlands, some estuaries, and giant kelp beds. Somewhat lower but still high rates occur in temperate forests and grasslands, tropical savannas, upwelling zones, and much of the North Atlantic Ocean north of 40° N. The lowest rates of net primary production occur in deserts and in the subtropical gyres of the world’s oceans.</p>

<p class="para">Primary productivity on land is limited primarily by temperature and the availability of water. The highest rates of net primary productivity are found in tropical rain forests, where water is plentiful and temperatures favorable, and the lowest rates in deserts, where water availability is low. Nutrients are also an important control. Phosphorus is often limiting in tropical rainforests, while nitrogen is commonly limiting in terrestrial ecosystems at higher latitudes and in deserts.</p>

<p class="para">Nutrient limitation is more important as a control on net primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems than on land, and patterns of net primary productivity are regulated by the interaction of nutrient availability and light penetration into the water column. The highest productivity is found in upwelling ecosystems and in nutrient-laden estuaries, while the lowest rates are found in the subtropical ocean gyres where nutrient availability is very low. Nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be equally limiting in these subtropical gyres, while nitrogen alone is often more limiting in estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems and phosphorus alone is often more limiting in freshwater lakes.</p>

<p class="para">In the oceans and lakes, secondary productivity by herbivores is approximately an order of magnitude less than the primary productivity on which it is based. That is, the trophic transfer efficiency is approximately 10%. Energy is lost at each feeding step because consumption efficiencies, assimilation efficiencies, and production efficiencies are all less than 100%. In terrestrial ecosystems, the trophic transfer efficiency from primary producers to herbivores is even lower than in phytoplankton-based ecosystems, since trees and grasses have far less protein, and far more hard-to-digest structural materials that are low in nitrogen, than do phytoplankton.</p>

<p class="para">While energy flows through an ecosystem, nutrients and other matter are cycled. For nutrients such as phosphorus, iron, potassium, and calcium, geological processes are important and the role of bacterial processes is relatively small (largely limited to mineralizing the nutrients during decomposition). On the other hand, geology plays a small role in the nitrogen cycle, which is dominated by a series of bacterially controlled processes such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification, in addition to mineralization.</p>
<p class="para indent">In all ecosystems, nutrients regularly cycle between inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, for instance, are assimilated by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria during primary production and converted into the organic tissues of these primary producers. As this material is consumed and decomposed by heterotrophic organisms, the nitrogen and phosphorus is mineralized and released back to the environment as inorganic forms. In ecosystems that are relatively closed to nutrient inputs, the rate of cycling of a limiting nutrient between inorganic and organic forms may be 50 to 100 times greater than the rate of new inputs of this limiting nutrient across the boundary of the ecosystem. In open systems, the external inputs of the limiting nutrient may equal or exceed the rate of cycling.</p>

<p class="para">Nutrients both enter and leave the ecosystem across its boundaries and come from a variety of sources. In terrestrial ecosystems, weathering of soil and bedrock is often the dominant input of nutrients such as phosphorus, iron, and calcium in regions where the soils are less than a few tens of thousands of years old. Where the soils are older and more weathered, this weathering input is reduced, and the input of nutrients from atmospheric deposition becomes more critical. Weathering is seldom an important source of nitrogen, which comes largely from atmospheric deposition and from nitrogen fixation. Nutrients leave terrestrial ecosystems in flowing waters, dissolved in the water or as part of eroded material. Nitrogen is also lost as N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> and N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub>O gases, the products of denitrification and nitrification.</p>
<p class="para indent">The nutrient losses that leave terrestrial ecosystems in flowing waters become the input to downstream aquatic ecosystems: streams, rivers, and lakes. Estuaries get nutrient inputs from rivers, but also from coastal ocean waters. Mixing of water from the deep ocean provides nutrients to many marine ecosystems, in addition to the river inputs for those near coastlines. Aquatic ecosystems also received nutrients from atmospheric deposition, which can be a major source in some of the more closed ecosystems such as the subtropical gyres. Nitrogen fixation is important in the subtropical gyres also and in many lakes, but it is seldom important elsewhere in the oceans.</p>

<p class="para indent">In this chapter, we very briefly discuss the phosphorus cycle, introduce the sulfur cycle and its role in acid rain, and then focus on the global carbon and nitrogen cycles, because these include many more ecological controls and feedbacks. We divide the carbon cycle into two separate parts—carbon dioxide and methane—since the ecological controls on these are quite different, and both are critical for understanding global change. For all these global cycles, we present both the natural cycle as it existed before the Industrial Revolution, and the modern cycle as influenced by human activities.</p>

Sulfate is also very important in the decomposition processes in sediments in many coastal marine ecosystems, is essential for life in that it is a component of several amino acids and other biologically important compounds, and undergoes a vast array of geochemical and microbial-mediated reactions. However, while sulfur is essential, it is seldom if ever limiting to primary productivity, as it has a high availability relative to the requirements of plants and algae in almost all ecosystems. Human activity over the past century has doubled the flux of sulfur gases through the atmosphere globally, and increased the deposition of sulfur to terrestrial ecosystems by 30-fold in some regions. This sulfur, most of which originates from burning fossil fuels such as coal, is a major component of acid rain (<span id="widget-63193" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63193" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63193"></div></span>), where it occurs as dilute sulfuric acid.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In the United States and much of Europe, aggressive regulation has reduced sulfur pollution since the 1970s, which has lessened the problem of acid rain. For example, at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where acid rain was first discovered in the 1960s, the acidity of rain fell by a factor of two between the 1960s and 2000 (<span id="widget-63194" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63194" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63194"></div>). In much of North America and Europe, sulfur pollution was once the major cause of acid rain, but nitrogen pollution (dilute nitric acid) is now more important. However, sulfur pollution and acid rain are growing problems elsewhere in the world, notably in China. Acid rain can cause many profound problems, including the loss of fish from lakes (<span id="widget-63195" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63195" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63195"></div></span>), the dieback of forests, and the loss of plant species richness generally (<span id="widget-63196" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63196" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63196"></div></span>).

For context, the human species has existed for only 30,000 years or so. This increase in carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases, as we discuss later in this chapter) has led to significant warming of the global environment over the past half-century (see <span id="widget-63199" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63199" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 3.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63199"></div></span>).

As ice was laid down in the Antarctic ice sheets, bubbles of atmospheric gases were trapped, preserving a historical record. With care, we can sample and assay the gases in these bubbles, and through a variety of techniques we can identify when the ice around them was formed, such as by looking for layers of volcanic ash (or chemical signatures of the ash) that correspond to volcanic eruptions in the historical record.<p></p>

In the subsequent 120 years, scientists have refined this understanding and included other factors, but Arrhenius’s prediction is remarkably robust: in its most recent report (IPCC, 2013), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide will increase the global temperature by between 2<sup class="txt-sup default">°</sup>C and 4.5<sup class="txt-sup default">°</sup>C.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Arrhenius also estimated the time he thought it would take for humans to cause a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide: 3,000 years. In this, he was way off target. Most modern scenarios predict 100 years instead. In part, Arrhenius’s estimate was low because he overestimated the rate at which the world’s oceans can absorb carbon dioxide. His bigger error, though, was his estimate of the rate at which humans would burn fossil fuels. He assumed that the release of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion would continue into the future at 1900 values, while in fact emissions have already grown 20-fold.</p>
<p class="para indent">At the time, Arrhenius’s research was not widely accepted. Another famous chemist, Knut Ångström, criticized his conclusions and said increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide would have no effect on global warming. Other scientists believed the oceans would always take up carbon dioxide as quickly as human activity produced it. However, by the 1950s, fossil fuel consumption had increased dramatically, and many scientists began to suspect that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere was rising. One of these, Charles Keeling (<span id="widget-63205" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63205" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.4b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63205"></div>) of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, developed a sensitive method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide and began monitoring the air at a remote site in Hawaii in 1958 when he was 30 years old. Those measurements have been made continuously to the present day. Keeling became the first scientist to confirm that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were indeed rising.<p></p>

The location was chosen to minimize short-term variation in carbon dioxide concentrations associated with metabolism, such as we see within a forest canopy (see <span id="widget-63209" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63209" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 3.22</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63209"></div></span>), and to obtain data more likely to reflect global, long-term trends. Nonetheless, the influence of metabolism is apparent in the “Keeling curve,” driven by the seasonal balance of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration in the temperate ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere, as we noted in <span id="widget-63210" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63210" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 3.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63210"></div></span>. The carbon dioxide concentrations are highest each year at the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the dominance of respiration over GPP in the winter. Monitoring stations in North America show a much more pronounced oscillation in carbon dioxide each year, while at the South Pole the oscillation is quite small—less than 1 ppm. At all monitoring sites, however, the trends from year to year show a steady and accelerating rate of increase in the carbon dioxide concentration: the global average increased by 1.7 ppm per year between 1993 and 2002, and then by 2.1 ppm per year from 2003 to 2013.<p></p>

However, fossil fuels are not the only source of this atmospheric carbon dioxide: the cutting down of forests also contributes, and in fact this was the major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide before 1900. This deforestation releases carbon dioxide when wood is burned but also during decomposition and respiration of dead biomass and organic matter in forest soils. Forest clearing in both the temperate zone and tropics has been an important source of carbon dioxide since at least the mid 1800s, but since 1960, the tropics have grown and the temperate zone has shrunk in importance (<span id="widget-63213" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63213" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.7</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63213"></div></span>).

<p class="para">less than half of emitted carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere …</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Not all the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity accumulates in the atmosphere. For instance, the increase of 2.1 ppm per year we observed in the first decade since 2000 corresponds to an accumulation rate of carbon dioxide mass in the atmosphere of 4.1 Pg C per year (a Pg, or petagram, is 10<sup class="txt-sup default">15</sup> g). However, human activity was adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere at a rate of 8.8 Pg C per year over this time period, with 7.7 from fossil fuel combustion and 1.1 from deforestation. Less than half this carbon dioxide stayed in the atmosphere. Where did the rest of it go? Ecologists, oceanographers, and other scientists who have studied this issue over the past few decades agree that the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems each have taken up and stored roughly equal portions of this missing carbon. They refer to the sites of such storage of an element, or to the mechanism for loss of a material (in this case atmospheric carbon dioxide), as <span class="txt-bold">sinks</span>. On average, the ocean sink and the terrestrial sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide are estimated to be roughly equal: 2.3 to 2.4 Pg C per year respectively in the early 2000s. These sinks are critically important in reducing the impact of fossil fuel combustion. Without them, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be going up much more quickly, and the planet would be warming much more quickly.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c12-sec-0005">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Understanding the carbon dioxide sinks</h2>
<p class="para">Will the sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to function in the same manner in the future as they have in the past? Or might either the ocean sink or the terrestrial sink become more or less effective in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere? The future trend in global warming is intimately tied to these sinks, and the trajectory of warming will change if their effectiveness changes. Below, we explore in some detail the mechanisms behind the sinks, the precision with which the sinks are known, and how the sinks may change in the future.</p>
<p class="para indent">The terrestrial carbon dioxide sink is simply the balance between net primary productivity (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration, or net ecosystem production (NEP), summed for all the terrestrial ecosystems on Earth. Terrestrial NPP globally is an estimated 56.4 Pg C per year (see <span id="widget-63214" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63214" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Table 11.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63214"></div>). The net average accumulation of carbon in terrestrial biomes (the global rate of terrestrial NEP) is 2.4 Pg C per year (as of the early 2000s) and is thus 4% of the rate of NPP. This implies that the rate of heterotrophic respiration in the terrestrial biosphere globally is 54.0 Pg C per year (<span id="widget-63215" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63215" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63215"></div></span>). Of course, we do not know the global rates of NPP and respiration with any precision: estimating NPP in any given ecosystem is itself subject to error, and scaling all the rates for all terrestrial ecosystems across the planet is difficult. We should not be surprised to learn that the uncertainty in the global rates may be 30% or even more. However, the accumulation of carbon in terrestrial NEP is not estimated by the difference between estimates of NPP and respiration globally; rather it is inferred from the difference between the known rates of input of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (8.8 Pg C per year in the early 2000s) and the sum of the relatively well-known rate of accumulation in the atmosphere (4.1 Pg C per year in the early 2000s) and the estimate of uptake by the oceans (2.3 Pg C per year), which we will discuss next.<p></p>

The mixing of waters makes the oceans far easier than terrestrial ecosystems to sample in a representative way.

See <span id="widget-63216" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63216" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.8</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63216"></div>.<p></p>

The difference between NPP and respiration of 11 Pg C per year represents organic carbon that sinks or is mixed into the deep oceans, where it is then largely respired to carbon dioxide. The exchange of dissolved carbon dioxide between the surface oceans and deep oceans is large, due to mixing and flows of water masses as we discussed in <span id="widget-63218" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63218" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63218"></div></span>.

These flows, together with the sinking of organic detrital carbon to the deep oceans, represent a net flux to the deep oceans of 2.3 Pg C per year, the same value as for the net flux from the atmosphere to the surface oceans. It is the deep oceans that are the important sink for carbon dioxide, with the surface oceans simply serving as a vector.<p></p>

Remember this deep-ocean sink for carbon dioxide is temporary, lasting a few centuries on average; as deep-ocean water makes its way slowly to the Southern, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and then rises again to the surface, much of the carbon dioxide is released back to the atmosphere. In future centuries, uptake by the world’s oceans will change to a net release of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Even if the inputs from fossil fuel combustion are reduced, this will result in continuously high atmospheric levels for many hundreds of years to come.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">In general, if there were no change in ocean physics and circulation, we would expect the oceans to take up more carbon dioxide as the concentration in the atmosphere increases, simply because the higher atmospheric concentration increases the diffusion of the gas. On the other hand, the surface oceans are warming as the global climate warms, and this lowers the solubility of carbon dioxide and therefore reduces the net rate of uptake by the oceans. The net effect of the increase in carbon dioxide and the higher temperatures is highly uncertain, as shown by the diverging predictions of 11 global change models in <span id="widget-63222" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63222" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.9</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63222"></div> (Friedlingstein et al., 2006<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0195">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0195</a>-->).

As we will see below, the future uptake of carbon dioxide by terrestrial ecosystems is even more uncertain, and these uncertainties are some of the greatest challenges to our ability to correctly predict future global climate change.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Will the terrestrial carbon dioxide sink change in the future?</h2>
<p class="para">Let’s return to the net uptake of carbon dioxide by terrestrial ecosystems, estimated as 2.4 Pg C per year in recent years, but with significant year-to-year variability (see <span id="widget-63225" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63225" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63225"></div>). At least part of this sink results from net accumulation of organic matter in biomass and soils during forest succession on lands abandoned from agriculture in the temperate zone in the late 19th and 20th centuries (see <span id="widget-63226" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63226" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 4.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63226"></div></span>). As these forests grow, GPP greatly exceeds ecosystem respiration for many decades, resulting in high rates of net ecosystem production and an accumulation of organic matter both in the tree biomass and in forest soils (<span id="widget-63227" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63227" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.12</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63227"></div></span>). Year-to-year variation in GPP and respiration, driven by variation in precipitation and temperature, may in part explain the large amount of variation we estimate for the terrestrial ecosystem sink. Eventually, as forest succession continues for 80 to 100 years or more, the rate of GPP levels off and may even fall. Respiration, however, continues to rise, and in a fully mature forest it may roughly equal GPP. At this point, net ecosystem production is zero and there is no further net uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide; the amount of organic matter in biomass and soils remains high but no longer increases. We can expect the net rate of carbon dioxide uptake (net ecosystem production) in these temperate forests to slow in coming decades.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Given all this uncertainty about the future of the global carbon cycle, then, what <span class="txt-italic">can</span> we conclude? The increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—primarily from burning fossil fuels—is the main driver of the observed rate of global warming. This trend will continue for as long as we continue to burn fossil fuels. Scientists understand the current dynamics of the global carbon cycle with reasonable certainty, but our understanding of the future dynamics is very uncertain. As carbon dioxide increases and temperatures rise, both the ocean sink and the terrestrial ecosystem sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide will change, but we simply cannot predict with any accuracy how these changes will play out. Some model predictions give us reason to hope that the carbon sinks will grow and help mitigate global climate change, but others indicate the sinks may not grow sufficiently, and that the terrestrial biomes may actually shift and become a net source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, even further accelerating global warming.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Can we reduce carbon dioxide emissions?</h2>
<p class="para">Burning fossil fuels is the major cause of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Hence, any solution to the global warming problem requires a large reduction in these emissions from fossil fuels. An important step is to use energy more efficiently. Per capita, residents of the United States are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide globally (although total emissions from China, with its large population, have surpassed those for the entire United States since 2005) and also use energy far less efficiently than Europeans do. New technologies can help increase the efficiency of energy use; electric cars are more efficient than any gasoline-powered vehicles, and total emissions from driving an electric car are lower even if the electricity comes originally from burning fossil fuels (Jacobson &amp; Delucchi, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0287">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0287</a>-->2011).</p>
<p class="para indent">Another approach is to trap the carbon dioxide released as fossil fuels are burned, perhaps storing it in water in deep caverns, although the water would become strongly acidic and corrosive, and leakage back to the surface would remain a concern. We could also continue to burn fossil fuels but rely more on natural gas and less on coal, since the carbon dioxide emissions to obtain the same amount of energy from natural gas are less. This idea, though, ignores the role of methane as a greenhouse gas, as we discuss in the next section. Perhaps the best approach is to move as quickly as possible to implement truly renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power. Jacobson and Delucchi (<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0288">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0288</a>-->2009) have proposed that such a radical change in energy use is obtainable, using currently available technologies, within 20 years.</p>

<p class="para">Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas responsible for the present rate of global warming. Several other gases are also important, notably methane and nitrous oxide. We discuss nitrous oxide in the context of the global nitrogen cycle later in this chapter. In this section, we focus on methane.</p>
<p class="para indent">Methane absorbs infrared radiation at wavelengths where carbon dioxide, water vapor, and most other greenhouse gases do not. As a result, per molecule it is far more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. On the other hand, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is much lower than that of carbon dioxide, and the increase in methane concentrations over natural levels is less than for carbon dioxide in absolute terms (although greater as a proportional change, as we pick up on later in this section). The net consequence is that the global warming caused directly by methane today is equivalent to approximately 30% of the warming caused by carbon dioxide, if we look simply at the concentration of methane in the atmosphere (a <span class="txt-bold">radiative forcing</span> of 0.48 Watts per square meter per year for the increase in methane, compared to 1.66 Watts per square meter for carbon dioxide; radiative forcing is the “imbalance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation” that results in global warming IPCC, 2007). This increases to 60% of the warming caused by carbon dioxide, however, if we also include the indirect effects of methane on other radiatively active materials in the atmosphere (which increases the radiative forcing for methane to 1.0 Watts per square meter per year; IPCC 2013). One example of such an indirect effect is the catalytic role of methane in producing ground-level ozone, another greenhouse gas.</p>

<p class="para indent">We saw that for atmospheric carbon dioxide, the sinks stored organic carbon (in biomass and soils) in terrestrial ecosystems and dissolved carbon dioxide in the oceans. For atmospheric methane, the sink is the chemical alteration of methane to other compounds. By far the largest methane sink is photooxidation in the atmosphere, which oxidizes the gas to carbon dioxide and water. The chemistry behind this reaction is reasonably well understood, and this allows us to conclude with some precision that the global sink for methane is approximately 570 Tg C (a Tg is 10<sup class="txt-sup default">12</sup> g) per year (IPCC, 2007).</p>
<p class="para indent">For carbon dioxide, the increase in the atmosphere is a significant proportion of the flux into the atmosphere. This accumulation is far less pronounced for methane, which has a shorter residence time in the atmosphere: approximately 12 years vs. a century for carbon dioxide. The input of methane to the atmosphere is roughly equal to the sink, or approximately 570 Tg C of methane per year in recent years. Since the change in concentration in the atmosphere over time is directly proportional to the inputs, we know from the time before the Industrial Revolution that the natural inputs then were approximately 220 Tg C of methane per year. Assume that these natural fluxes have remained constant over the past few centuries. We can then estimate the inputs that result from human activity as the difference between the current total and natural fluxes as 350 Tg C of methane per year (570 minus 220).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">The natural sources of methane</h2>
<p class="para">Although we can estimate the total magnitude of the natural methane flux with some precision, identifying its individual components is less easy. Methane is produced biologically in many different types of ecosystems, but some also seeps into the atmosphere from ancient geological formations. A global survey of such seeps concluded that this natural geological source represents a flux of 53 Tg C of methane per year, plus or minus 20% (Etiope et al., 2008<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0162">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0162</a>-->). Accepting this estimate leaves us searching for another 167 Tg C of methane per year from natural sources (220 minus 53).</p>
<aside class="sidenote sidenote-2" id="c12-feafxd-0012">
<div class="box">
<p class="para">most of the natural flux comes from oxygen-free decomposition</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The natural biological sources are dominated by <span class="txt-bold">methanogenesis</span>, the production of methane by bacteria in the absence of oxygen. As long as oxygen is present in an environment, bacteria will use oxygen in their respiration, decomposing organic matter and oxidizing the organic carbon to carbon dioxide. In the absence of oxygen, they use other strategies for their respiration and decomposition, one of which is methanogenesis. During methanogenesis, bacteria obtain only 100 KJ of energy per mole of carbon they decompose, as opposed to some 500 KJ per mole of carbon for bacteria using oxygen-based respiration. Bacteria making their living through methanogenesis could therefore never outcompete oxygen-respiring bacteria for organic substrates when oxygen is present. But when oxygen is absent, methanogenesis provides a mechanism for bacterial life and decomposition to continue, albeit with low energy gains. In freshwater wetlands and the sediments of freshwater lakes, methanogenesis is often the major form of decomposition. Little or no oxygen occurs in these environments, since the diffusion of oxygen is 10,000 times slower in waterlogged soils and sediments than in soils having air pores, and whatever oxygen starts to diffuse into the soils and sediments is rapidly consumed.</p>
<p class="para indent">Much of the methane formed in these wetlands and lake sediments escapes to the atmosphere. The precise magnitude of these methane fluxes is unknown, since the fluxes are highly variable over both space and time, making measurement difficult. Our most reasonable estimates for the global flux from wetlands, developed from measurements from individual wetlands multiplied by the area of wetlands on the planet, vary from 80 to 280 Tg C of methane per year. Similar estimates for lakes vary from 10 to 73 Tg C of methane per year (IPCC 2007). Of course, at the higher end, these estimates exceed the value of 167 Tg C of methane per year that seems likely to be produced from all natural biological sources.</p>
<p class="para indent">Some methane is also produced in the guts of animals, including termites, through methanogenesis by bacteria in their guts, which are oxygen-free (see <span id="widget-63242" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63242" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.3</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63242"></div>). Estimates for the atmospheric flux of methane from termites have ranged up to 150 Tg C of methane per year, based on methane production by individual termites and the global population of termites. However, recent studies have documented that most of the methane produced in termite mounds is oxidized by bacteria in the mound and never reaches the atmosphere (Jamali et al., 2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0290">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0290</a>-->). The atmospheric methane source from termites is probably in the range of 1 Tg C of methane per year. The guts of cows and other ruminants are even more productive of methane, as we discuss below when we turn to anthropogenic sources.<p></p>

<p class="para">the oceans produce little methane …</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The oceans are a source of methane to the atmosphere, but perhaps a surprisingly small one given the area of the planet covered by the oceans; they represent a flux of only about 10 Tg C of methane per year (IPCC, 2007). The concentration of methane in the oceans is above the saturation level relative to the atmosphere. It is therefore certain that the net flow of methane is from the oceans to the atmosphere. However, the flux is low. Also, as the salinity of wetlands increases, the methane flux to the atmosphere dramatically decreases (<span id="widget-63243" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63243" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.17</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63243"></div>).

<p class="para indent">Why is the flux from oceans so much less than from lakes? And why is the flux from coastal wetlands so much less than from freshwater wetlands? The reason is simply that the concentration of sulfate is so much greater in seawater than in freshwaters. As we discussed above, methanogenesis dominates decomposition in many freshwater wetlands and lake sediments when oxygen is absent. But bacteria that use sulfate in their respiration to decompose organic matter obtain 130 KJ of energy per mole of carbon, which is far less than bacteria that can use oxygen, but nonetheless substantially more than obtained by methane-producing bacteria. Hence, bacteria using sulfate (reducing the sulfate to sulfides, while oxidizing the organic matter to carbon dioxide) will outcompete methane-producing bacteria for decomposable organic matter wherever sulfate is present. Sulfate reduction is therefore the dominant decomposition process in coastal marine wetlands whenever salinity is sufficiently high to supply sulfate (<span id="widget-63244" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63244" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.17</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63244"></div>) and in most coastal marine sediments.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Anthropogenic sources of methane</h2>
<p class="para">Emissions from developing and using fossil fuel use are one of the largest source of atmospheric methane from human activities, making up approximately one-third of the anthropogenic sources (see <span id="widget-63245" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63245" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Table 12.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63245"></div>). Of the total estimated flux from fossil fuels of 115 Tg C per year, more than half comes from the natural gas industry (Howarth et al., 2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0258">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0258</a>-->). Natural gas makes up only 20% of the global use of fossil fuels (see <span id="widget-63246" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63246" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.6</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63246"></div></span>), so we can see that the methane emissions per unit of production of natural gas are far greater than for coal and oil. This makes sense, since natural gas is composed largely of methane, and even small leakages and releases of natural gas add up to large methane emissions. In contrast, methane is a small contaminant of oil and coal.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">As with all such global fluxes, our estimates for fossil fuel emissions are uncertain; the values in <span id="widget-63247" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63247" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Table 12.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63247"></div> may well be 20% to 30% lower or higher, and perhaps even higher (Howarth et al., 2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0258">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0258</a>-->; Kirschke et al., 2013). However, the amount of radioactive <sup class="txt-sup default">14</sup>C in the methane in the atmosphere provides a check on these estimates. Methane formed from biological processes such as the decomposition of organic matter in recent years contains <sup class="txt-sup default">14</sup>C, because it is being continuously produced in the atmosphere from cosmic radiation and because nuclear bomb tests in the atmosphere in the 1960s contributed even more. On the other hand, methane from ancient geological formations contains no <sup class="txt-sup default">14</sup>C, because this radioactive isotope has a half-life of 5,730 years and will have decayed away over a time period of millions of years. From measurements of <sup class="txt-sup default">14</sup>C in present-day atmospheric methane, therefore, we know that roughly 30% of the methane comes from ancient sources, while the remainder comes from modern biologically mediated sources (Lassey et al., 2007<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0338">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0338</a>-->; Etiope et al., 2008<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0162">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0162</a>-->). Our estimates for the natural geological seeps (53 Tg C of methane per year) plus the anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions (115 Tg C of methane per year) equal a total estimate of 168 Tg C of methane per year from ancient sources. This, too, comes in at 30% of the total global flux, increasing our confidence in both estimates.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The other anthropogenic sources are many, all uncertain, although we can have some confidence that the sum of these is around 235 Tg C of methane per year (350 Tg C for all anthropogenic sources minus 115 Tg C for the fossil fuel emissions). Most of this is produced by bacterial methanogenesis, in flooded rice paddies (which are human-made wetlands, similar in function to natural freshwater wetlands), in the oxygen-free guts of cows and other livestock, and during bacterial decomposition of organic matter in landfills, sewage treatment facilities, and manure from livestock, all of which are often oxygen-free as well. Human activity is simply creating new environments for this natural process of methanogenesis on a massive scale. The single largest of these sources, after fossil fuels, is probably animal agriculture. Animal agriculture emissions have grown tremendously over the past half-century as the global production of meat has increased 5-fold and continues to rise. The drivers behind this increased consumption are both human population growth and an increase in meat consumption per person, which almost doubled since 1960.

On the other hand, efforts to reduce methane emissions would have more immediate benefits, greatly slowing the trend in global warming even without reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Reducing both carbon dioxide and methane gives the best outcome, with not only immediate benefits in a slowed rate of warming but also continued slowing of warming after 2040 or so.<p></p>

There is also much concern that warming will increase the flux of methane from natural ecosystems to the atmosphere, possibly at temperatures of only 1.8<sup class="txt-sup default">o</sup>C above the long-term baseline (Zimov et al., 2006<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0655">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0655</a>-->; Hansen et al., 2007<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0228">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0228</a>-->). One mechanism is that as the permanently frozen soils of the tundra biome melt, they will become wetlands, and huge amounts of methane will result from the decomposition of their soils, which are rich in organic carbon but lacking in oxygen (see <span id="widget-63251" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63251" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63251"></div>). Another worry is that methane clathrates, forms of frozen methane or methane crystals that are abundant in sediments at intermediate depths in many coastal ocean areas, will melt and release huge quantities of gaseous methane. Reducing the anthropogenic fluxes of methane to the atmosphere is one of the best opportunities to slow global warming over the coming decades, and to lower the risk of encountering tipping points.<p></p>

<section class="section-5" id="c12-sec-0013">
<p class="para">Conventional sources of natural gas are being rapidly depleted around the world. Some, though, are optimistic that we will continue to have a large supply. Shale rock often holds large amounts of natural gas, but it is tightly held and was not available for commercial exploitation until the development of two technologies in the late1990s: high-volume hydraulic fracturing of rock (“fracking”), combined with precision drilling of gas wells along distances of 1 to 2 km or more into shale formations often only 50 m thick. Industry executives and many politicians have promoted this shale gas as a ‘bridge fuel’ to the future that would allow society to continue to use fossil fuels over the next few decades while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This belief is based on the fact that far lower levels of carbon dioxide are released when we burn natural gas than when we consume oil or coal to obtain the same amount of energy.</p>
<p class="para indent">Confidence in shale gas was challenged by new research in 2011, summarized in a commentary to the journal <span class="txt-italic">Nature</span> by Howarth and Ingraffea (2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0260">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0260</a>-->). Noting that carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas of concern and that natural gas is composed largely of methane, they wrote: ‘Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, so even small emissions matter. Over a 20-year time period, the greenhouse-gas footprint of shale gas is worse than that for coal or oil. The influence of methane is lessened over longer time scales, because methane does not stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide. Still, over 100 years, the footprint of shale gas remains comparable to that of oil or coal’ (<span id="widget-63252" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63252" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.19</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63252"></div>).<p></p>

When we consider carbon dioxide emissions alone, natural gas has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. Including methane emissions changes this picture and suggests that natural gas may have a very large greenhouse gas footprint. (Howarth &amp; Ingraffea, 2011.)</span>

<p class="para indent">This argument assumes far larger emissions of methane from developing and using natural gas resources – especially shale gas, but also natural gas from conventional sources—than from oil or coal. Methane emissions from gas development are not known with certainty, and one of the recommendations from the commentary was to obtain better data about them. As we write, many new studies are coming out, some with surprising results (<span id="widget-63253" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63253" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.20</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63253"></div>). For instance, some new wells being drilled to develop shale gas emit very large quantities of methane to the atmosphere even before the shale formations are reached and hydraulically fractured to release gas, perhaps because more shallow pockets of gas are encountered on the way (Caulton et al., 2014).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">A counterargument is that we must take the long-term view. Carbon dioxide added to the environment in our lifetimes will persist and influence the climate for centuries to come, while the time frame of influence for methane emissions is relatively short. In this alternate view, reducing carbon dioxide emissions is paramount to all other considerations.</p>
<p class="para indent">Many approaches for reducing greenhouse gases do focus on carbon dioxide rather than on methane, and they have the perverse potential to increase methane emissions and therefore aggravate global warming over the coming few decades. For example, a ‘carbon tax’ on emissions of carbon dioxide may favor natural gas over coal or oil as a fuel because carbon dioxide emissions to obtain the same amount of energy are lower, even though total greenhouse gas emissions may be higher when we consider methane. Economic markets for trading of emission credits may act in a similar way if they focus only on carbon dioxide and do not consider other greenhouse gases. The time scale is paramount as well. If we compare the warming potential of methane to that of carbon dioxide only at time scales of 100 years rather than over the next few decades, we don’t necessarily see the critical need to immediately reduce methane emissions.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">How should we weigh the long-term consequences of carbon dioxide emissions against shorter-term concerns about methane? Currently, economic markets for carbon release and sequestration consider methane only on the time scale of 100 years. Is this approach protective enough to reduce global warming, if methane leads to excessive warming that surpasses critical tipping points in the global climate system? Does natural gas from shale make sense as a way to address global change, or should society work more aggressively to reduce use of all fossil fuels?</span></p>

<p class="para">Like carbon dioxide emissions, methane emissions can be greatly reduced if we move away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable wind and solar power sources. Doing so quickly buys the Earth’s climate system some critically needed time (see <span id="widget-63254" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63254" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.18</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63254"></div>).

The other major sources of global methane are rice farming and animal agriculture, and ecologists and other biologists are hard at work to develop approaches for reducing these sources.

Humans have had an immense effect on the global nitrogen cycle, particularly by using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture. The rate of acceleration in the global nitrogen cycle due to human activity is staggering, with most of the growth in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer occurring over just a few decades, compared to one or more centuries for carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation, and human population growth (<span id="widget-63256" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63256" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.21</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63256"></div>).

However, a significant amount of nitrogen, an estimated 30% of the quantity fixed in the landscape, flowed to the oceans (Galloway et al., 2004), where, in addition to the nitrogen fixed in the oceans themselves, it was largely denitrified. If we assume the global rate of denitrification was roughly equal to the 240 Tg of nitrogen per year that was fixed, then an estimated 160 Tg of was probably denitrified in the oceans and only 80 Tg in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.

<p class="para indent">A majority of the denitrification in the world’s oceans—both today and centuries ago—occurs in the sediments of the continental shelves. Although the sediments of the deep oceans cover a far greater area, they also receive much lower inputs of organic matter; the organic-rich sediments of the continental shelf provide a more favorable site for denitrification. As noted by Falkowski (1997<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0165">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0165</a>-->), the area of the continental shelves has varied over geological time; at the height of the last glaciation 22,000 years ago, sea levels were far lower since so much of the Earth’s water was tied up in glacial ice. As a result, the area of the continental shelves was significantly less, and globally the rate of denitrification was probably less during this period of glaciation than during the past 10,000 years. The rate over the past 100 years has clearly increased, because human activity has created biologically available nitrogen at faster rates and much of it has flowed to coastal oceans.</p>

<p class="para">The huge increase in the rate of supply of biologically available nitrogen over the past half-century has led to numerous and diverse environmental problems including coastal eutrophication and dead zones (see <span id="widget-63273" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63273" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 1.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63273"></div>) and loss of biotic diversity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (<span id="widget-63274" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63274" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 1.5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63274"></div></span>). As we noted in <span id="widget-63275" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63275" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 12.1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63275"></div></span>, nitrogen is increasingly the dominant cause of acid rain in many regions, both because nitrogen pollution is growing and sulfur pollution is lessening in most developed countries. The acceleration of the nitrogen cycle has also led to increased fluxes of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas (see <span id="widget-63276" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63276" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.22</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63276"></div></span>). In fact, nitrous oxide is the third most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane in the observed trends in global warming, and it is more potent per molecule in its global warming potential than either of these other two gases. In addition, nitrogen pollution contributes directly to human diseases, including cancer and heart disease, by catalyzing, along with methane and other hydrocarbon gases, the formation of toxic ozone in the lower atmosphere (which also damages forest and agricultural productivity), by forming into very fine particles, and by the reaction of nitrate with organic matter in the human gut to form potently carcinogenic compounds called nitrosamines. However, while the creation of more ozone in the lower atmosphere is harmful to us, nitrous oxide also contributes to the <span class="txt-italic">destruction</span> of ozone in the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, leading to “ozone holes,” which allow excess ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth’s surface. These further effects on human health are taken up again in <span id="widget-63277" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63277" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 14.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63277"></div></span>.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Nitrogen pollution further affects the health of both animals and humans through indirect, ecologically mediated mechanisms. For instance, nitrogen deposition leads to increased pollen formation by many plants, increasing allergies. One of the best-studied effects of nitrogen pollution is on amphibian disease. Amphibian populations are in decline globally, in part due to an increase in deformities that reduce their fitness and survival (<span id="widget-63278" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63278" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.26a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63278"></div>). Many of these deformities are caused by a parasite, a trematode (fluke worm) named <span class="txt-italic">Ribeiroia ondatrae</span>, that has an intermediate snail host. That is, for part of its life cycle, the organism is a parasite of snails, and then later, a parasite of frogs and other amphibians. When snails and frogs are raised together in mesocosms, the frogs have no deformities if no parasites are present. When parasites are added, some deformities occur, and more occur when more parasites are added. The incidence of deformities increases further when nitrogen and phosphorus are added (<span id="widget-63279" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63279" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.26b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63279"></div></span>). The mechanism is an increase in the parasite load in the snails, which are more productive in the fertilized mesocosms due to more algal production. <span class="txt-italic">Ribeiroia ondatrae</span> is closely related to the parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans, a deadly disease that also has a snail intermediate host. We can reasonably surmise that nitrogen pollution may also aggravate schistosomiasis.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Regional variation in nitrogen pollution</h2>
<p class="para">The acceleration of the nitrogen cycle is a global phenomenon, driven by global changes in agricultural practices (such as intensification of meat production and its segregation from sites of crop production, discussed in <span id="widget-63280" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63280" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63280"></div>), energy use, food production, and other human activities. We have already noted the global effect of nitrous oxide gas on global warming and on the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere. However, the other effects of the change in nitrogen cycling are far from uniform across the planet.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Nitrogen pollution is much greater in some regions than in others: the hot spots include most of Europe, India, eastern China, the eastern portion of the United States, and southern Brazil (<span id="widget-63281" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63281" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figures 12.27a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63281"></div>).

These areas of intense human use of nitrogen are generally not the regions with the greatest rates of natural nitrogen fixation. So while human activity has roughly doubled the rate of creation of nitrogen on the Earth, the rate of change is quite small in some areas such as the Amazon, but massive in regions such as Europe where the human use of nitrogen is high and the rate of natural nitrogen fixation is low. The regional variation in nitrogen fluxes and pollution is well illustrated by the amount of nitrogen that leaves the landscape and flows to estuaries and coastal oceans, leading to dead zones and other aspects of eutrophication (<span id="widget-63284" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63284" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 12.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63284"></div></span>). Per area of watershed, these nitrogen fluxes vary across the planet from less than 100 to more than 5,000 kg per square kilometer per year. The fluxes are highly correlated with the rate of input of nitrogen to the landscape by human activity.<p></p>

<h5 class="level-5 txt-parrot">Nitrogen Inputs to the Landscape Control Nitrogen Fluxes in Rivers</h5>
<section class="section-5" id="c12-sec-0019">
<p class="para">In recent decades, human activity has dramatically increased nitrogen inputs to coastal marine ecosystems, with often devastating consequences (<span id="widget-63285" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63285" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 1.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63285"></div>). This nitrogen pollution comes from a variety of sources in the landscape. Here we present a relatively simple tool for assessing these sources and determining how they relate to the flow of nitrogen in rivers to the coast. The approach is based on comparing the total mass of nitrogen inputs from all human-controlled sources to large watersheds with the measured mass flows of nitrogen in rivers, both normalized to the area of the watershed. Perhaps surprisingly, robust sources of data on nitrogen inputs such as fertilizer use and atmospheric deposition (see <span id="widget-63286" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63286" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 11.8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63286"></div></span>) are more reliable at larger spatial scales, such as a large river basin, than at the scale of a small forested catchment or plot of agricultural field.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Despite all the complex ecological processes that occur in terrestrial ecosystems and rivers – and despite the diversity of underlying soils and geologies, climates, and ways that humans interact with the landscape across regions—we can see a very strong relationship between the amount of nitrogen that humans put into the landscape and the amount that flows down rivers to coastal waters. This speaks strongly to the huge influence humans are having on the nitrogen cycle at regional scales.</p>
<p class="para indent">The inputs of nitrogen from human activity at the scale of large river basins are the use of synthetic fertilizer, nitrogen fixation by bacterial symbionts of agricultural crops, atmospheric deposition that originates from fossil fuel combustion, and the net movement of nitrogen into or out of the river basin in food for humans and feeds for animals. We can obtain values for these inputs from governmental data, models of nitrogen flow through the atmosphere, and information about what humans and animals eat and how much nitrogen fixation is associated with particular crops. When we sum the inputs, we obtain an estimate of the total net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (NANI) to a river basin or region. In many cases, there is a net export of food and feeds, and we treat these as negative input. <span id="widget-63287" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63287" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.28a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63287"></div> illustrates what these net inputs look like across the United States.<p></p>

</figure>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">When the NANI sum is plotted against the average flux of nitrogen in rivers to the coast for 150 watersheds in Europe and the United States, a strong linear relationship results (<span id="widget-63288" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63288" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.28b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63288"></div>). This relationship is highly significant, and the NANI term alone explains a high proportion of the variation in riverine nitrogen fluxes across these regions. Note that both the inputs and the riverine fluxes are expressed per area of watershed. The total mass flux of nitrogen to the coast is a function of both this area-specific flux and the area of the watershed. The Mississippi River exports a huge amount of nitrogen to the northern Gulf of Mexico, creating the ‘dead zone’ there. This arises from a moderately high nitrogen flux per area combined with a very large river basin consisting of more than 40% of the entire area of the lower 48 states of the United States.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In many estuaries, sewage is the major input of nitrogen. Why is sewage not included in this NANI-based analysis? In effect, it is. Sewage is part of the internal workings of NANI, with the nitrogen in sewage coming from the food humans eat, and this in turn originates with food grown in the river basin (based on fertilizer inputs and agricultural nitrogen fixation) or imported to the region. We can think of the sewage as a recycling of nitrogen. Double accounting would result if we considered it a separate input of nitrogen to the river basin.</p>
<p class="para indent">On average, for the 150 watersheds shown in <span id="widget-63289" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63289" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.28b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63289"></div>, 25% of the human-controlled nitrogen inputs (NANI) are exported to the coast in rivers. Some of the rest accumulates in the biomass and soil of the terrestrial ecosystems in the basins, but most is probably denitrified. Much of the variation in the regression shown in this figure is related to climatic variability. In river basins with more freshwater flowing out as a result of greater precipitation, a higher percentage of the nitrogen inputs are exported to the ocean. This suggests that less denitrification occurs in these wetter river basins. Given that denitrification occurs in wet places such as wetlands, seasonally flooded soils, and streams, this finding might surprise you. The likely answer is that in regions with more precipitation and greater flows, the water and associated nitrogen may pass through wetlands and streams so quickly that bacteria are less able to denitrify as much of it.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">How can we reduce nitrogen pollution?</h2>
<p class="para">Many technical solutions exist for reducing nitrogen pollution. In fact, atmospheric nitrogen pollution in both Europe and the United States has decreased substantially over the past 20 years as power plants and vehicles have been required to use technologies that reduce their emissions of oxidized nitrogen gases. On the other hand, such pollution has increased in the developing world as energy use has increased. In many western cities, the use of nitrogen-removing technologies in sewage treatment facilities has greatly reduced water pollution. So far, efforts to reduce nitrogen pollution from large-scale agriculture have been less successful, although there are many proven approaches for doing so, as we will explore in <span id="widget-63290" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63290" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63290"></div>. This suggests the need for better policy approaches for encouraging ways to reduce agricultural pollution.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">There may be some reason to hope that improved lifestyles may reduce nitrogen pollution. For instance, if the average U.S. adult were to reduce consumption of meat to that of the average resident of southern Europe as of the 1980s, total fertilizer use would fall dramatically, since meat production and the crop production necessary to support it would be far less (<span id="widget-63291" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63291" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 12.29</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63291"></div>). Overconsumption of food, and particularly of meat, is increasingly recognized as a major health issue in many developed countries. An improvement in diet would be good for us individually.

Combustion of fossil fuels, which is the major source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, has increased exponentially over the past century. Deforestation also contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Terrestrial biomes and the oceans both provide sinks for some atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating somewhat of a buffer against the increase from human activity. However, these sinks may be temporary.</p>

<p class="para">Methane also contributes significantly to global warming. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere was relatively low until the Industrial Revolution but has risen exponentially over the past century. Expressed as a percentage change, the rate of methane increase is even greater than that for carbon dioxide. The climate system responds more rapidly to methane than to carbon dioxide, so immediate control of methane emissions provides one of the best ways to slow global warming and avoid possible tipping points in the climate over the coming decades. Methane is formed by bacterial decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, and the formation in wetlands and lakes from this mechanism is a large, natural source of methane. Humans have increased methane fluxes to the atmosphere by increasing sites for this bacterial formation of methane in the guts of livestock, in rice paddies, and in landfills. Humans have also increased the flux of methane to the atmosphere from fossil sources as natural gas, oil, and coal are developed for fuel.</p>

<p class="para">The rate of change in the global nitrogen cycle from human activity is even faster than that for the global carbon dioxide and methane cycles. Before the Industrial Revolution, the global nitrogen cycle was a balance between the bacterial fixation of nitrogen in the oceans and in terrestrial ecosystems and the bacterial conversion of nitrogen forms back to molecular N<sub class="txt-sub default">2</sub> through denitrification. The major driver of the acceleration of the nitrogen cycle is the intensification of agriculture based on synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, the use of which has increased exponentially over the past 50 years. The combustion of fossil fuels also contributes to nitrogen pollution. The human creation of biologically available nitrogen equaled the natural rate of nitrogen fixation in terrestrial biomes in the 1970s and is now approaching a rate equal to all natural nitrogen fixation on the planet, including that in the oceans. Nitrous oxide, the third most important greenhouse gas behind current global warming, has increased in the atmosphere as nitrogen use has increased. Nitrogen pollution has many other effects—both ecological and human health related—but these effects tend to play out at local to regional scales.</p>

<p class="para">what is biodiversity?</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">The term <span class="txt-italic">biodiversity</span>, which we have mentioned throughout this book, also makes frequent appearances in both the popular media and the scientific literature. But what precisely does it mean? At its simplest, it means <span class="txt-italic">species richness</span>, the number of species present in a defined geographic unit (see <span id="widget-63301" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63301" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 10</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63301"></div>). But we can also view biodiversity at scales smaller and larger than the species. For example, we may include genetic diversity within species, perhaps seeking to conserve genetically distinct subpopulations and subspecies (see <span id="widget-63302" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63302" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 8</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63302"></div></span>). Above the species level, we may wish to ensure that species without close relatives are afforded special protection, so that the overall evolutionary variety of the world’s biota is maintained as large as possible. At a larger scale still, we may include in biodiversity the variety of community types present in a region—swamps, deserts, early and late stages in a woodland succession, and so on. Thus, biodiversity may itself have a diversity of meanings. Yet it is necessary to be specific if the term is to be of any practical use. Ecologists must define precisely what it is they mean to conserve in their particular circumstances, and how to measure whether this has been achieved.<p></p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">In some cases, as we shall see in this chapter, conservation efforts are focused on individual species and hence on biodiversity only indirectly, whereas in others there is a more explicit focus on whole habitats and so on biodiversity itself. In either case, what are the options available to us? Broadly, we can either protect or restore. Among the protective measures available to us, we can simply fence off areas to keep out whatever the threat is, or we can manage an area (protect a food plant, eliminate hunting or disturbance) to reduce or even eliminate that threat. In either case we will make important decisions about where and how large the fenced-off or managed area should be.</p>
<p class="para indent">Alternatively, we may relocate individuals from an area where the species is thriving (relatively speaking) to one where it is now extinct, or breed individuals in an artificial setting before reintroducing them, or even re-create whole ecosystems, especially in areas where all or most of the habitat has been destroyed (for example by logging or mining). We can think of these cases of restoration as conservation in a broader sense, since the aim is to reverse a past failure to conserve. We will meet examples of all these interventions later in the chapter.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Conservation biologists, then, are concerned with the loss of species in the face of human influence. To judge the scale of the problem, though, we need to know the total number of species currently in the world, the rate at which these are going extinct, and how this rate compares with that of pre-human times. Unfortunately, there are considerable uncertainties in our estimates of all three. About 1.8 million species have so far been named (<span id="widget-63303" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63303" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63303"></div>), but the real number must be much larger. Estimates have been derived in a variety of ways. One approach, for example, uses information about the rate of discovery of new species to project forward, group by taxonomic group, to a total estimate of up to 6–7 million species in the world. However, the uncertainties in estimating global species richness are profound, and our best guesses range from 5–10 million eukaryotes, plus the bacteria and viruses, with defensible numbers overall ranging from 3 to 100 million (May, 2010<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0396">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0396</a>-->).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">An important lesson from the fossil record is that the vast majority of species eventually become extinct—more than 99% of species that ever existed are now no longer with us. However, given that individual species are believed, on average, to have lasted about 1–10 million years, and if we estimate conservatively that the total number of species on Earth is 10 million, then we would predict that on average, only between 100 and 1,000 species (0.001–0.01%) would go extinct each century. The current observed rate of extinction of birds and mammals is about 1% per century, 100–1,000 times this ‘natural’ background rate (see also <span id="widget-63304" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63304" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63304"></div>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The evidence, then, while based only on estimates, suggests that our children and grandchildren may live through a period of species extinction comparable to the ‘natural’ mass extinctions evident in the geological record, when, for example, many whole families of shallow-water invertebrates were lost towards the end of the Permian period, around 250 million years ago, and some estimate that around 96% of the species then living went extinct.

<p class="para">To most people, biological diversity is undeniably of value, but standard economics has generally failed to assign tangible value to ecological resources. Thus, the costs of environmental damage and the depletion of living resources have frequently been disregarded. A major challenge is the development of a new <span class="txt-italic">ecological economics</span> (Daly &amp; Farley, 2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0124">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0124</a>-->) in which the worth of species, communities, and ecosystems can be assigned financial value to be set against the gains to be made in industrial and other human projects that may damage them.

<p class="para indent">Many species have direct value. Many more are likely to have a potential value that as yet remains untapped. For example, wild meat, fish, and plants remain vital resources in many parts of the world, while most of the world’s food is derived from plants that were originally domesticated from wild plants in tropical and semiarid regions. In the future, wild strains of these species may be exploited for their genetic diversity, and quite different species of plants and animals may be found that are appropriate for domestication.</p>
<p class="para indent">Further, as we shall see in <span id="widget-63308" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63308" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 14.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63308"></div>, the potential benefits that might come from natural enemies if they could be used as biological control agents for pest species are enormous; most natural enemies of most pests remain unstudied and often unrecognized. Finally, about 40% of the prescription and nonprescription drugs used throughout the world have active ingredients extracted from plants and animals. Aspirin, probably the world’s most widely used drug, was derived originally from the leaves of the tropical willow, <span class="txt-italic">Salix alba</span>. The nine-banded armadillo (<span class="txt-italic">Dasypus novemcinctus</span>) has been used to study leprosy and prepare a vaccine for the disease; the Florida manatee (<span class="txt-italic">Trichechus manatus</span>), an endangered mammal, is being used to help understand hemophilia; while the rose periwinkle (<span class="txt-italic">Catharanthus roseus</span>), a plant from Madagascar, has yielded two potent drugs effective in treating blood cancer. In all these cases, the species can be thought of as representing ‘provisioning ecosystem services’ (see <span id="widget-63309" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63309" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 13.5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63309"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Other species have indirect economic value. More ingenuity is required to find ways to measure this value. For example, many wild insects are responsible for pollinating crop plants. This is another provisioning service, and one that we are getting less benefit (value) from as many countries report a catastrophic decline in bees. In a different context, the monetary value of ecotourism, which depends on biodiversity, is becoming ever more considerable. Each year, around 200 million U.S. adults and children take part in nature recreation and spend about $4 billion on fees, travel, lodging, food, and equipment. Ecotourists, who visit a country wholly or partly to experience its biological diversity, spend approximately $12 billion a year worldwide on their enjoyment of the natural world (Primack, 1993<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0474">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0474</a>-->).</p>
<p class="para indent">On a smaller scale, a multitude of natural history films, books, and educational programs are consumed annually without harming the wildlife upon which they are based. In these contexts, biodiversity provides ‘cultural ecosystem services.’ Furthermore, biological communities can be of vital importance by maintaining the chemical quality of natural waters, buffering ecosystems against floods and droughts, protecting and maintaining soils, regulating local and even global climate, and breaking down or immobilizing organic and inorganic wastes. All these are ‘regulating ecosystem services.’</p>
<p class="para indent">Many people point to ethical grounds for conservation, with every species being of value in its own right—a value that would still exist even if people were not here to appreciate or exploit the natural world. From this perspective even species with no conceivable economic value require protection. It would be wrong, though, to see things only from the point of view of conservation. Not that there are really arguments <span class="txt-italic">against</span> conservation as such. But there are arguments in favor of the human activities that make conservation a necessity: agriculture, the felling of trees, the harvesting of wild animal populations, the exploitation of minerals, the burning of fossil fuels, irrigation, the discharge of wastes, and so on. To be effective, therefore, the arguments of conservationists must ultimately be framed in cost–benefit terms, because governments will always determine their policies against a background of the money they have to spend and the priorities accepted by their electorates.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">A government conservation authority is considering a proposal to designate a marine reserve at a rocky promontory of great scenic beauty.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Demographic risks associated with small populations</h2>
<p class="para">Much of conservation biology is a crisis discipline. For example, the residual population of giant pandas in China (or yellow-eyed penguins in New Zealand or spotted owls in North America) has become so small that if nothing is done, the species may become extinct within a few years or decades. There is thus a pressing need to understand the dynamics of small populations. These are governed by a high level of uncertainty, in contrast to those of large populations, which can be described as being governed by the law of averages (Caughley, 1994<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0091">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0091</a>-->). Two different kinds of uncertainty are of particular importance.</p>
<ol class="order-list" epub:type="list" id="c13-list-0003">
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para"><span class="txt-italic">Demographic uncertainty.</span> Random variations in the number of individuals that are born male or female, or in the number that happen to die or reproduce in a given year, or in the genetic quality of the individuals in terms of survival/reproductive capacities can matter very much to the fate of small populations. Suppose a breeding pair produces a clutch consisting entirely of females. Such an event would go unnoticed in a large population but could be the last straw for a species down to its last pair.</p></li>
<li class="list-item" epub:type="list-item"><p class="para"><span class="txt-italic">Environmental uncertainty.</span> Unpredictable changes in environmental factors, whether disasters (such as floods, storms, or droughts of a magnitude that occurs very rarely) or relatively minor events (year-to-year variation in average temperature or rainfall), can also seal the fate of a small population. A small population is more likely than a large one to be reduced by adverse conditions to zero or to numbers so low that recovery is impossible. And of course global climate change may greatly aggravate this influence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="para indent">To illustrate some of these ideas, take the demise in North America of the heath hen (<span class="txt-italic">Tympanuchus cupido cupido</span>). This bird, once extremely common from Maine to Virginia, was highly edible, easy to shoot, susceptible to introduced cats, and affected by conversion of its grassland habitat to farmland. It is perhaps not surprising then that by 1830 it had disappeared from the mainland and was found only on the island of Martha’s Vineyard. In 1908 a reserve was established for the remaining 50 birds, and by 1915 the population had increased to several thousand. But 1916 was a bad year. Fire (a disaster) eliminated much of the breeding ground, there was a particularly hard winter coupled with an influx of goshawks (environmental uncertainty), and finally poultry disease arrived on the scene (another disaster). At this point, the remnant population was likely to have become subject to demographic uncertainty. For example, of the 13 birds remaining in 1928, only two were females. A single bird was left in 1930, and the species went extinct in 1932.</p>

The preservation of genetic diversity is important in the first place because of the long-term evolutionary potential it provides. Rare forms (<span class="txt-italic">alleles</span>) of a gene, or combinations of alleles, may confer no immediate advantage but could turn out to be well suited to changed environmental conditions in the future.

<p class="para indent">Greater prairie chickens (<span class="txt-italic">Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus</span>), closely related to the heath hens described above, provide a good example of how genetic diversity may be related to population size. These birds were once widespread throughout the prairies of North America, but with the loss and fragmentation of this habitat, many populations have become small and isolated. Prairie chicken populations were once linked by the gene flow provided by migrants, keeping genetic diversity high. But the current populations are not only small but also isolated in their habitat fragments. Johnson et al.

The mean number of alleles per gene was 7.7–10.3 in the large populations but only 5.1–7.0 in the small. Franklin and Frankham (1998<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0190">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0190</a>-->) had previously suggested that an effective population size of 500–1,000 might be needed to maintain longer-term evolutionary potential.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">A more immediate potential problem arises because when populations are small, related individuals tend to breed with one another. All populations carry recessive alleles that can be harmful, even lethal, to individuals when homozygous (when the alleles provided by the mother and father are identical). Individuals that breed with close relatives are more likely to produce offspring that receive harmful alleles from both parents. The deleterious effects that result are known as <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c13-tdef-0003" title="a loss of vigor amongst offspring occurring when closely related individuals mate, resulting from the expression of numbers of deleterious genes in a homozygous state and from a generally low level of heterozygosity" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - inbreeding depression">inbreeding depression</span>.

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">It is, though, possible to reduce and perhaps even solve the genetic problems in small populations. The pink pigeon (<span class="txt-italic">Columba mayeri</span>) provides a good example. Once widespread on the island of Mauritius, it had declined to a population of only 9 or 10 birds by 1990. Other animals had been maintained in captivity, but that captive population was originally descended from just 11 founder individuals, augmented in 1989–1994 by adding 12 more (offspring of the remaining wild individuals). The aim, therefore, was to manage matings in captivity, so as to retain high levels of genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding, and then release offspring back into the wild. Between 1987 and 1997, scientists reintroduced 256 birds on Mauritius, wherever possible selecting birds with minimal inbreeding (based on records in breeding ‘stud books’) and releasing them in groups with good representation of the different founder ancestries. As a result, the population had swelled to 355 free-living individuals by 2003 (plus more in captivity) and has remained at or above that level since.</p>
<p class="para indent">Preoccupation with avoiding inbreeding has been justified by studies in which the genetics and ecological success of both captive and wild pink pigeon populations have been carefully monitored.

<p class="para">Clearly, populations on the way to extinction are small, whether they travel that road all the way to its destination or are stalled or even turned back. But what sets a population on this path? We turn next to some of the more important factors that threaten the future of species populations and hence of biodiversity more generally.</p>
<section class="section-2" id="c13-sec-0011">
<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Overexploitation</h2>
<p class="para">The essence of overexploitation is that populations are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. We shall examine the phenomenon in more detail in <span id="widget-63318" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63318" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 14.7</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63318"></div>, but the basic idea is easy to grasp. In prehistoric times, for example, it seems likely that humans were responsible for the extinction of many large animals, the so-called megaherbivores, by overhunting them—removing them at a faster rate than the animals themselves could counter with their own reproduction. In much the same way, in more recent times, populations of the great whales and many commercial fish species are in danger of following a similar path.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In many cases, the endangered species is being exploited for food, often as a staple of the diet. But often the ‘food’ value of the species is exotic and imaginary (for instance, the supposed medicinal powers of rhino horn in some Asian cultures), or the species are exploited for ‘aesthetic’ reasons, whether for their body parts or as exotic pets. In these cases, their value to collectors goes up as they become rarer. Thus, instead of the normal safeguard of a density-dependent reduction in consumption rate at low density (see <span id="widget-63319" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63319" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 7.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63319"></div>), increased rarity may actually increase the rate of exploitation, unless hunting and other forms of removal are strictly regulated.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Elephant ivory is a good example. African elephants have been exploited for ivory for many years, and as they have become rarer, the resource itself has become more valuable. For example, the estimated numbers of elephants in Africa was 1.3 million in 1979, reduced to 600,000 by 1989, whereas the value of uncarved ivory in Kenya was $2.5 a pound in 1969, $34 a pound in 1978, and more than $90 a pound in 1989 (Lemieux &amp; Clarke, 2009<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0349">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0349</a>-->). Between 1979 and 1989, the two countries suffering the greatest reduction in elephant numbers were the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania (<span id="widget-63320" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63320" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.9a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63320"></div>). The consequent rarity inevitably increased the value of what remained, so conservation of elephants would have been possible only with well-resourced and well-organized control of elephant hunting (poaching).<p></p>

Of these, forest clearance has been, and still is, the most pervasive of the forces of habitat destruction (<span id="widget-63323" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63323" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.10a,b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63323"></div>). Much of the native temperate forest in the developed world was destroyed long ago, but current rates of deforestation remain high in all forest biomes (<span id="widget-63324" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63324" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.10c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63324"></div></span>), though it is likely that more of this forest loss currently is natural (for example, forest fires) in temperate zones, whereas more is human-induced in tropical zones. The process of habitat destruction also often makes the habitat available to a particular species more fragmented than in the past, with potentially serious effects for the populations concerned (see <span id="widget-63325" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63325" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 13.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63325"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Third, habitat may simply be <span class="txt-italic">disturbed</span> by human activities to the detriment of some of its occupants. Habitat disturbance is not such a pervasive influence as destruction or degradation, but certain species are particularly sensitive. For example, diving and snorkeling on coral reefs, even in marine protected areas (see <span id="widget-63331" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63331" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 13.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63331"></div>), can cause damage by means of direct physical contact with hands, body, equipment, and fins. Often individual disturbances are minor, but these can result in serious cumulative damage. In one analysis of 214 divers in a marine park on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, 15% of divers damaged or broke corals, mostly by fin flicks (Rouphael &amp; Inglis, 2001<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0502">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0502</a>-->). Specialist underwater photographers caused more damage on average (1.6 breaks per 10 minutes) than divers without cameras (0.3 breaks per 10 minutes). Impacts were also much more likely to be caused by male than female divers. Nature recreation, ecotourism, and even ecological research are not without risk of disturbance and the decline of the populations concerned.<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Global environmental change</h2>
<p class="para">When the environment changes, species may find themselves without a home, or with a home that is no longer large enough to accommodate them, or with a home that has moved too far or too fast for them to follow. One way to assess the extinction risk of species under global climate change, therefore, is to estimate the loss in area of key habitats on the basis of predicted changes to temperature and rainfall. Thus, for example, the characteristic biota of the Cape Floristic Province, discussed in <span id="widget-63332" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63332" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 13.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63332"></div>, is expected to lose 65% of its habitable area by 2050. On the basis of the general pattern relating species richness to area (see <span id="widget-63333" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63333" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 10.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63333"></div></span>), this represents a reduction of 24% in number of species (Thomas et al., 2004<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0579">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0579</a>-->). However, this conclusion is based on the optimistic assumption that species are capable of dispersing to all currently uninhabited areas that become inhabitable. If we assume no dispersal, and future ranges are simply what remains of current ranges, then 30–40% of species are at risk of extinction.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">In a similar way, Beaumont and Hughes (2002<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0037">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0037</a>-->) used predicted climate changes to model the future distributions of 24 Australian butterfly species. Under even a moderate set of future conditions (temperature increase of 0.8–1.4°C by 2050) the distributions of 13 of the species decreased by more than 20% (<span id="widget-63334" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63334" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63334"></div>). Most at risk are butterflies like <span class="txt-italic">Hypochrysops halyetus</span>, that not only have specialized food plant requirements, but that also depend on the presence of ants for a mutualistic relationship (see <span id="widget-63335" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63335" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 8.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63335"></div></span>). This species is predicted to lose 58–99% of its current range. Moreover, only one-quarter of its predicted future distribution occurs in locations that it currently occupies. This highlights a very important general point: regional conservation efforts and current nature reserves may turn out to be in the wrong place in a changing world.<p></p>

A second category of cacti, whose current ranges are almost equally within and outside the reserve, are expected to contract their ranges, but in such a way that their distributions become almost completely confined to the reserve. In the case of these cacti, then, the location of the reserve seems to cater adequately for potential range changes. But how many other nature reserves may turn out to be in the wrong place?<p></p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Introduced and invasive species</h2>
<p class="para">Invasions of exotic species into new geographic areas sometimes occur naturally and without human agency. However, human actions have increased this trickle to a flood. Human-caused introductions may occur either accidentally as a consequence of human transport, or intentionally but illegally to serve some private purpose, or legitimately to procure some hoped-for public benefit by bringing a pest under control, producing new agricultural products, or providing novel recreational opportunities. Many introduced species are assimilated into communities without much obvious effect. However, some have been responsible for dramatic changes to native species and natural communities.</p>
<p class="para indent">For example, the accidental introduction of the brown tree snake <span class="txt-italic">Boiga irregularis</span> onto Guam, an island in the Pacific, has through nest predation reduced 10 endemic forest bird species to the point of extinction. The gradual spread of the snake from its bridgehead population in the center of the island has been paralleled by the loss of bird species to the north and south (<span id="widget-63337" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63337" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.13</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63337"></div>). Similarly, the introduction as a source of human food of the predaceous Nile perch (<span class="txt-italic">Lates nilotica</span>) to the enormously species-rich Lake Victoria in East Africa has driven most of its 350 endemic species of fish to or near extinction (Kaufman, 1992).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Conservation biologists are particularly concerned about the effects of introduced species wherever there are communities of native organisms that are largely <span class="txt-italic">endemic</span> (that is, that live nowhere else in the world). Indeed, one of the main reasons for the world’s great biodiversity is the occurrence of centers of endemism, in which similar habitats in different parts of the world are occupied by different groups of species that happen to have evolved there (<span id="widget-63338" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63338" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 2.6</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63338"></div>). If every species naturally had access to everywhere on the globe, we might expect a relatively small number of successful species to become dominant in each biome.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The extent to which this homogenization can happen naturally is restricted by the limited powers of dispersal of most species in the face of the physical barriers. But the transport opportunities offered by humans have allowed an ever-increasing number of species to breach these barriers. The resulting homogenization is then partly a reflection of the same species being introduced repeatedly, and partly a result of the loss of local endemic species. For freshwater fish in the United States, at least, it seems that the former is more important than the latter (<span id="widget-63339" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63339" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.14a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63339"></div>).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Infectious disease</h2>
<p class="para">We saw earlier, when we described the final years of the heath hen, how infectious disease may play its part in the decline of a species towards extinction. This integral role, embedded in a range of factors, is probably typical. Recently, however, the power of infectious disease in its own right in driving species to extinction has been emphasized by the plight of amphibian species worldwide (see <span id="widget-63344" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63344" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63344"></div>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">An estimated 50% of all amphibian species are currently facing an extinction crisis, with more than 100 already classified as extinct or possibly extinct. One cause is the worm infections we discussed in <span id="widget-63345" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63345" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 12.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63345"></div>. But in addition, chytrid disease, caused by the fungus <span class="txt-italic">Batrochochytrium dendrobatidis</span>, has recently been implicated as the immediate cause of catastrophic declines in more than 200 of the 350 species it is known to infect (Fisher, Garner, &amp; Walker, 2009<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0173">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0173</a>-->). Although it was identified for the first time only in 1997, its effects undoubtedly go back further than that.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">One example is illustrated in <span id="widget-63346" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63346" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.16a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63346"></div>, which shows the moving wave of amphibian declines in Central America from 1987 to 2004.

Prior to the die-off, none of more than 1,500 frog samples from 43 species showed any sign of the infection.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Combinations of risks and extinction vortices</h2>
<p class="para">Some species are at risk for a single reason, but often, as in the case of the heath hen discussed earlier, a combination of factors is at work, perhaps occurring sequentially. Among these may be the genetic effects described above, though no clear example of extinction due to genetic problems has so far come to light. On the other hand, it may be that inbreeding depression has occurred, though undetected, as part of the ‘death rattle’ of some dying populations (Caughley, 1994<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0091">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0091</a>-->). Thus, a population may have been reduced to a very small size by one or more of the processes described above, and this may have led to an increased frequency of matings among relatives and the expression of deleterious recessive alleles in offspring, leading to reduced survivorship and fecundity and causing the population to become smaller still—a so-called <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c13-tdef-1001" title="the condition that arises from the death of the last surviving individual of a species, group, or gene, globally or locally" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - extinction vortex">extinction vortex</span> (<span id="widget-63350" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63350" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.17a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63350"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The declining population of a shore bird in Sweden, the southern dunlin, <span class="txt-italic">Calidris alpina schinzii</span>, appears to be entering such a vortex. During the study period, 1993–2004, the population declined steadily (<span id="widget-63351" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63351" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.17b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63351"></div>), but habitat loss that had previously threatened the species, and reduced the size of its populations, had been arrested by this time, so it cannot have been the cause of the decline. However, there was clear evidence that close relatives were increasingly breeding with one another (<span id="widget-63352" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63352" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.17c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63352"></div></span>), and that reduced heterozygosity, an inevitable consequence of inbreeding, was leading to an increase in the failure of dunlin eggs to hatch (<span id="widget-63353" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63353" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.17d</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63353"></div></span>). The population has continued to decline, despite active measures to increase breeding success, including preventing the trampling of nests by cattle.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Chains of extinctions?</h2>
<p class="para">So far, we have looked at individual species, treating them as though they were largely independent entities. Conservation of biodiversity, however, also requires a broader perspective in which we apply our knowledge of whole communities and ecosystems. We can deduce from studies of food webs and keystone species, for example (<span class="link">Section 9.5</span>), that a chain of extinctions may follow inexorably from the extinction of a particular native species, which therefore deserves special attention. The island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean provides some good examples.</p>
<p class="para indent">First, flying foxes (large fruit bats) in the genus <span class="txt-italic">Pteropus</span>, which occur on many South Pacific islands, are the major, and sometimes the only, pollinators and seed dispersers for hundreds of native plants (many of which are of considerable economic importance, providing medicines, fiber, dyes, prized timber, and foods). Flying foxes are highly vulnerable to human hunters and there is widespread concern about declining numbers Cox et al., 1991<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0119">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0119</a>-->. On Guam, the two indigenous flying fox species are either extinct or virtually so, and there are already indications of reductions in fruiting and dispersal. Guam is also now home to the brown tree snake, as we saw earlier (<span id="widget-63354" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63354" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.13</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63354"></div>), and indeed, the snake may have contributed to the decline of the flying foxes. Its most devastating effects, however, have been on indigenous birds, many species of which are also important pollinators, and here too, the cascading effects from snake to pollinating birds to plants are apparent.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">A comparison with the nearby but nearly snake-free island of Saipan for two important tree species showed, first, that visits by pollinating birds had ceased on Guam and pollinating visits overall were significantly down (<span id="widget-63355" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63355" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.18a,b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63355"></div>), but also that recruitment of the trees (i.e., appearance of seedlings and saplings) was failing (<span id="widget-63356" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63356" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.18c</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63356"></div></span>). These studied species are only examples of tree species on Guam pollinated mainly by birds. Hence, if urgent conservation measures are not taken to protect the plants, this lowered recruitment may in due course be fatal.<p></p>

We now return to these measures and to the decisions about where and when to apply them. Mainstream ecological scientists have not always applied fundamental principles to issues like conservation. A few far-sighted ecologists led the way for others to follow.

<p class="para indent">In 2006, the Environment Agency [of the UK] published a poll of its top 100 eco-heroes of all time. Next to Charles Darwin was the name of Tony Bradshaw, a pioneer of restoration ecology, who has died aged 82. That juxtaposition was stunningly appropriate, for Tony made his name as an evolutionary biologist. His work on the evolution of tolerance to heavy metals in plants growing in contaminated soils remains the clearest and best example of evolution in action, and Darwin would have applauded it.</p>
<p class="para indent">Where Tony left his academic colleagues in the shade was by applying that brilliant, fundamental research to the restoration of vegetation and functioning ecosystems to derelict land, first on mine sites in Wales and later in his adopted city of Liverpool and world-wide. His ability to move seamlessly between the worlds of fundamental and applied science may now be more common, but in the 1960s and 70s was unusual and even disdained by some.</p>

<p class="para indent">The son of an architect, Tony was born in Kew, Surrey, and was interested in plants from an early age. As a 13-year-old at the outbreak of the Second World War, he dug for victory—literally. The entire front garden of the family house was turned over to vegetables under his care, despite being on heavy clay. Perhaps that experience seeded his lifelong interest in making soil in unlikely places. After graduating in botany at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1947, he moved to the University College of Wales, first as a research student in Aberystwyth and then as a lecturer at Bangor. His work on metal tolerance was outstanding. He demonstrated the power of natural selection to bring about rapid evolutionary changes in natural grasses, even when the populations were separated by only very short distances, which conventional theory at the time regarded as impossible because gene flow between the populations was thought to swamp the disruptive effects of selection. Consequently, locally adapted races could evolve easily.</p>
<p class="para indent">Tony quickly saw the potential of this discovery to help restore polluted soils. In 1968 he took the Chair of Botany at Liverpool University, and the range of degraded environments covered by his lab expanded quickly. Spoil heaps from coal, slate and china clay mines, limestone quarries, metal wastes, the bare margins of reservoirs and urban dereliction all fell under his gaze.</p>
<p class="para indent">The key to his work was creating soil on these damaged sites without resorting to the then standard technique of importing topsoil at great expense (and at great damage to the source of the soil). Consequently, huge areas of land could be restored to health because the costs of doing so were so low.</p>
<p class="para indent">In 1982 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and other honours followed, including the presidency of the British Ecological Society, of which he was made an honorary member in 1988. Tony was involved with many environmental organisations, including the first Groundwork Trust, set up in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1981 as a partnership between the then Countryside Commission and local authorities to work with the community to bring about environmental change and the consequent social and economic benefits.</p>
<p class="para indent">The model was so successful that there are now more than 50 Groundwork Trusts in the UK, focused on communities where environmental dereliction goes hand-in-hand with social and economic deprivation, and has been replicated worldwide. In Britain, the movement has given rise to the Land Restoration Trust.</p>
<p class="para indent">He published more than 250 works, not just in mainstream scientific journals. His book The <span class="txt-italic">Restoration of Land</span> (1980), written jointly with Mike Chadwick, was the standard text on the subject, mixing science and practice fluently, and <span class="txt-italic">Trees in the Urban Landscape</span> (1995) set the same standards for those much abused ‘friends of the city.’</p>
<p class="para indent">Tony married Betty Alliston in 1955, and they had three daughters, Jane, Penny and Sarah. When Betty died in 2000, Tony stayed in Liverpool and continued to devote his knowledge and experience to the city, and helped transform its oldest public park, St James Gardens. Shortly before he died, he was made Liverpool’s first Citizen of Honour.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Population viability analysis</h2>
<p class="para">For the population of a rare species, one obvious question is: how great is the threat it faces? That is, given the environmental circumstances and its particular characteristics, what are the chances that it will go extinct in a specified period? How big does its population need to be to reduce the chance of extinction to an acceptable level? One simple approach to answering these questions is to determine the size of a <span class="txt-bold">minimum viable population</span> (MVP). What defines an MVP is a matter of individual judgment, but we might suggest, for example, that an MVP will have at least a 95% probability of persistence for 100 years. We can then explore data sets such as those shown earlier for the bighorn sheep in <span id="widget-63358" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63358" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.8b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63358"></div> to provide an approximate estimate of the MVP.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Bighorn populations of fewer than 50 individuals all went extinct within 50 years, while only 50% of populations of 51–100 sheep lasted for 50 years. Evidently, for an MVP here we require more than 100 individuals. Indeed, for these sheep, such populations demonstrated close to 100% persistence over the maximum period studied of 70 years. However, the conservation value of studies like this is limited because they rely on long-term data sets and therefore deal with species that are generally not at risk.</p>

This was done both for years when recruitment of seedlings occurred and when it did not. All sites with rates of increase greater than 1.35 when recruitment took place are managed by burning and some by mowing as well. None of these were predicted to go extinct during the modeled period. On the other hand, populations with no management regime, or whose management does not include fire, had lower rates of increase, and all except two had predicted extinction probabilities (over 1,000 years) from 0.10 to 1.00. The obvious management recommendation is to use prescribed burning to provide opportunities for seedling recruitment. Low establishment rates of seedlings may be due to rodents or ants eating fruits, or to competition for light with other plants—burnt areas probably reduce one or both of these negative effects.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Of course, areas may be protected without becoming part of the official IUCN portfolio, but we can see from the categories in <span id="widget-63367" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63367" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 13.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63367"></div> that any protected area must seek to satisfy a range of criteria that may often conflict with one another, and that different types of areas balance these criteria out in different ways. Notable among the criteria are conservation itself, access for humans for educational or recreational purposes, and the ability of humans to exploit the natural resources of the area, either directly for food, or more broadly to provide for their subsistence and well-being.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Deciding how best to resolve these conflicting requirements is itself an important issue in conservation. One example comes from the need to conserve butterflies in England but also for farmers to produce food from the same areas of land. Food can be produced conventionally, with the aid of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, or organically, without them. Yields tend to be lower on organic farms (although not by as much as is sometimes suggested; see <span id="widget-63368" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63368" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 14.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63368"></div>), so more land is needed to produce the same crop yield. However, organic farms provide better habitat for butterflies, although they are not so good for butterfly conservation as nature reserves are (<span id="widget-63369" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63369" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.21a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63369"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">A choice therefore exists between ‘land sharing’—farming organically and so producing food and protecting butterflies on the same land—and ‘land sparing’—farming intensively to produce food in some areas while conserving intensively in others such as nature reserves. The right choice depends not only on the relative values for conservation of different land uses, shown in <span id="widget-63370" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63370" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.21a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63370"></div>, but also on the relative yields of organic and conventional farms.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The search for the best solution is shown in <span id="widget-63371" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63371" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.21b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63371"></div>, which combines the two conflicting requirements. First, contours represent the density of butterflies to be expected at different combinations of nature reserves and organic farmland in the habitat. Second, there are lines representing combinations of equal overall farmland yield for different assumptions about relative yield on organic and conventional farms. Our starting point is the current situation in terms of the percentages of reserve, organic, and conventional farmland, also shown in the figure. The question is: how can we conserve the most butterflies while maintaining current yields? Our aim, therefore, is to choose the line that most accurately represents the organic/conventional balance of yield, and then find the point on that line that takes us as high up the density contours as possible, that is, that conserves the most butterflies.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The analysis in <span id="widget-63372" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63372" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.21b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63372"></div> indicates that if organic yields are lower than 87% of those achieved on conventional farms, then conventional farming and sparing land for nature reserves is the better conservation option. However, if we can achieve organic yields that are more than 87% of those on conventional farms, then sharing production and conservation on the same organic land is best. Clearly, decisions about whether and where to establish protected areas depend on more than simply what those areas are able to protect. And indeed, decisions about organic or conventional farming depend on more even than yields and conservation, as we discuss in <span id="widget-63373" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63373" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 14</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63373"></div></span>.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">As the name suggests, the space included in a marine protected area (MPA) is all or mostly marine, although portions of adjacent land areas are often included, particularly when the land is intimately tied to the marine ecosystem in function or culturally. For instance, a tropical MPA may include an atoll as well as the associated fringing coral reefs and adjacent marine waters. MPAs were developed first in the 1960s as a way to better protect marine biodiversity and fishery resources, using as an analogy the way national parks on land had helped conserve some of the ecological functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. By 2010, MPAs around the world had grown to include almost 6,000 sites encompassing a little over 1% of the world’s oceans (IUCN, 2010).</p>
<p class="para indent">Most MPAs are in coastal areas, and since the coastal ecosystems make up a relatively small portion of the global oceans (<span id="widget-63375" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63375" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63375"></div>), MPAs occupy a larger percentage of these coastal ecosystems: almost 3% of the waters lying within 320 km of coastlines (the “200-mile” limit of territorial waters claimed by most of the world’s nations as part of their territories) and over 6% within 20 km of coastlines (the “12-mile” limit that many nations more intensively manage).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">How effective are MPAs in conserving biodiversity and managing fishery resources? They vary tremendously in their effectiveness. Coral reefs are a particular focus for many MPAs, yet only a relatively few MPAs have been judged to be fully effective in protecting coral diversity and health (<span id="widget-63376" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63376" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.23</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63376"></div>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Some MPAs are <span class="txt-bold">no-take zones</span>: areas where no fishing is allowed. These areas are also well protected from land-based pollution sources and other human disturbances. In no-take zone MPAs, biodiversity is often maintained, and fishery resources grow in size and even help replenish fish populations in adjacent waters where fishing is still allowed. Hence, these MPAs are an overall benefit to commercial fishers despite being off limits to them. The Goat Island Marine Reserve in New Zealand, established in 1977, provides an example of such success, one that many subsequent MPAs have tried to emulate. Populations of snapper fish and crayfish that had been decimated by overfishing were reestablished within ten years, and now these and the near-pristine coastal ecosystem support both scientific research and extensive ecotourism.</p>
<p class="para indent">However, no-take zones do not always accomplish this goal. Sometimes the populations of predatory fish increase greatly, leading to a trophic cascade of fewer herbivores, an increase in macroalgae, and a decrease in biodiversity (see <span class="link">Section 9.5</span>). This may be more likely to happen in areas under stress for other reasons, such as nutrient pollution, where the lack of predatory fish and the resulting high abundance of herbivores can mask some of the symptoms of nutrient pollution. Clearly, the ecological details matter. Most MPAs, however, are not no-take zones, and fishing and many other practices are commonly allowed. In the United States, less than 1% of the area of all MPAs consists of no-take zones.</p>

<p class="para">marine protected areas must be sufficiently large to be effective</p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">The size of an MPA matters. Fish will of course swim freely in and out of the defined area of an MPA. To protect a fish population, therefore, the size of the MPA must be large relative to size of the home range of the fish of most concern. One calculation suggests that the MPA should be around 12.5 times the area of the species’ home range, in order to keep fishing pressure on the population within the MPA at 2% or less of the pressure outside (Kramer &amp; Chapman 1999<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0328">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0328</a>-->). Since home range increases with body size, this means that for a typical species 20 cm in length, the MPA should be 1.8 km<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup> in area. However, 30% of the world’s MPAs are smaller than this, providing inadequate protection to typical fish species that grow to 20 cm in length or more.</p>

<p class="para">limits to the powers of MPAs</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">While MPAs are an important step forward in the effort to protect marine ecosystems, they cannot do the job alone. They are focused on local protection of resources and provide little protection against global and regional threats. Global change poses high risk to many coastal ecosystems. Coral reefs, for example, are endangered by the increasing acidification of the world’s oceans as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to rise (<span id="widget-63377" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63377" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63377"></div>). Corals are damaged too by rising temperatures of surface-ocean waters, which can cause coral ‘bleaching’ (the loss of symbiotic algae in the corals, which causes the coral to lose color and become white).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">More generally, regional-scale nitrogen pollution can lead to eutrophication, dead zones, and loss of biodiversity and fishery resources at scales much larger than those of most MPAs. Hence, despite the growing area covered by MPAs, global biodiversity continues to fall, and the health of corals continues to decline (<span id="widget-63378" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63378" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.23</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63378"></div>). The trend globally for MPAs is similar to that for protected areas on land; for both, while protected areas have increased in size and number, they remain only a small percentage of the total, and biodiversity is clearly not adequately conserved.<p></p>

<p class="para">We are bound to want to devise priorities so that the restricted number of new protected areas, in terrestrial and marine settings, can be evaluated systematically and chosen with care. We know that the biotas of different locations vary in species richness (with particular centers of diversity), in the extent to which the biota is unique (with centers of endemism), and in the extent to which the biota is endangered (with hotspots of extinction, for example, because of imminent habitat destruction). Locally, no doubt, these are important considerations when protected areas are chosen. But on a global scale, it is not so clear that protected areas are most concentrated where they are most needed.</p>
<p class="para indent">For example, if we compare the global distribution of ‘biodiversity hotspots’ (as indicated by the number of globally threatened birds and amphibians in an area) with the global distribution of protected areas (<span id="widget-63379" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63379" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.24</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63379"></div>), we can see how the needs of conservation are being much better satisfied in the richer than in the poorer parts of the world.

We have seen too that populations can sometimes be sustained by dispersal from outside (<span id="widget-63382" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63382" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 5.4</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63382"></div></span>), and that for this reason, and also because the risk of extinction is spreading, connected metapopulations will be more likely to persist than their individual subpopulations (<span id="widget-63383" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63383" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 9.3</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63383"></div></span>).<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Of course, we have also seen throughout the book that species are found in habitats that provide their fundamental ecological niche (<span id="widget-63384" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63384" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 6.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63384"></div>), and that species richness (biodiversity) is favored by a whole range of factors (<span id="widget-63385" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63385" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 10</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63385"></div></span>). These ideas can be combined into a very basic recipe for successful conservation (<span id="widget-63386" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63386" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.25</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63386"></div></span>), which has three core ingredients: habitat quality, habitat area, and connectivity, the last of these being a combination of the spatial arrangement of suitable habitats and the provision of links between them.

However, the argument has also been made that while, ideally, all should be considered when locating and designing nature reserves, in practice money and resources for conservation are likely to be limited. It may then be best to focus on habitat quality and area, where benefits are predictable and likely to apply to a wide range of species, than on aspects of connectivity, which may be less predictable and more species-specific (Hodgson et al., 2011<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0249">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0249</a>-->).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">One particular question that may arise is whether to construct one large reserve or several small ones adding up to the same total area. If the region is homogeneous in terms of conditions and resources, it is quite likely that smaller areas will contain only a subset, and perhaps a similar subset, of the species present in a larger area. Species-area relationships (<span id="widget-63388" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63388" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 10.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63388"></div>) would then suggest that it is preferable to construct the larger reserve in the expectation of conserving more species in total. On the other hand, if the region as a whole is heterogeneous, then each of the small reserves may support a different group of species and the total conserved might exceed that in one large reserve of the same size. In fact, collections of small islands tend to contain more species than a comparable area composed of one or a few large islands. The pattern is similar for habitat islands and, most significantly, for national parks. Thus, studies have tended to favor several small areas (see <span id="widget-63389" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63389" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.27</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63389"></div></span>). Similarly, sets of smaller parks contained more species than larger ones of the same area in studies of mammals and birds in East African parks, of mammals and lizards in Australian reserves, and of large mammals in national parks in the United States.<p></p>

<p class="para">Throughout this chapter, we have seen examples where conservation efforts or concerns are concentrated on individual species, or on whole communities or habitats because of the collections of species they contain. The biodiversity that is the focus of attention in such cases has intrinsic value. But there is also a utilitarian view of nature that focuses on the value of what ecosystems provide for people to use and enjoy. The concept of ecosystem services, already touched upon in <span id="widget-63392" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63392" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 13.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63392"></div>, formalizes this view.

<p class="para">putting a value on Nature</p>
</div>

<p class="para indent">Economists can put a value on nature in a variety of ways. A provisioning service for which there is a market is straightforward—values are easily ascribed to clean water for drinking or irrigation, to fish from the ocean, and to medicinal products from the forest. A more imaginative approach is required in other situations. Thus, the travel costs that tourists are willing to pay to visit a natural area provides at least a minimum value for the cultural service provided. We can also estimate how much we would need to spend to replace an ecosystem service with a man-made alternative, for example, by substituting the natural waste disposal capacity of a wetland by building a treatment works. And when an ecosystem service has already been lost, the real costs become apparent.</p>
<p class="para indent">Take, for example, the largely deliberate burning of 50,000 km<sup class="txt-sup default">2</sup> of Indonesian vegetation in 1997. The economic cost was US$4.5 billion in lost forest products and agriculture, increased greenhouse gas emissions, reductions in tourism, and health care expenditure on 12 million people affected by the smoke (Balmford &amp; Bond 2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0026">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0026</a>-->). Even in 1997, when the concept of ecosystem services was first beginning to take hold, an aggregation of all the ecosystem services worldwide arrived at an estimate of US$38 trillion per year—more than the gross domestic product of all nations on the planet combined (Costanza et al., 1997<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0112">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0112</a>-->).

<p class="para">positive and negative human effects on ecosystem services</p>
</div>

<p class="para indent">In the case of three important provisioning services—production of crops, livestock, and aquaculture—human activities have had a positive effect. Likewise, the abandonment of agricultural land with regrowth of forest in many parts of the temperate zone over the past century has had a positive influence on the terrestrial sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (<span id="widget-63393" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63393" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 12</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63393"></div>).

The continuing loss of forest in tropical regions has negative effects on the ability of the terrestrial ecosystem to regulate river flow, because deforestation increases flow during flooding and decreases it during dry periods. And, as we saw in <span id="widget-63395" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63395" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapters 1</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63395"></div></span> and <span id="widget-63396" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63396" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63396"></div></span>, deforestation (or even just the loss of riverside vegetation) can diminish the terrestrial ecosystem’s capacity to hold and recycle nutrients (another regulating service), releasing large quantities of nitrate and other plant nutrients into waterways.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">The modification of an ecosystem to enhance one service generally comes at a cost to other services previously provided. Thus, the intensification of agriculture to produce more crop per hectare – a provisioning service – is accompanied by the loss of regulating services such as nutrient uptake and of cultural services such as sacred sites, streamside walks, and valued biodiversity (Townsend, 2007<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0594">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0594</a>-->).</p>

<p class="para indent">We humans have appropriated much of global net primary production for ourselves, especially through agricultural use. We have already seen how farming and wildlife conservation can come into conflict and how that conflict might be resolved (<span id="widget-63397" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63397" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 13.21</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63397"></div>). We now examine the interaction of farming with ecosystem services.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">When farm production becomes too intensive and widespread, biodiversity is lost because of the loss of species-rich habitat remnants and the impact of high levels of pesticides. At the same time there may be an adverse effect on ecosystem services like the provision of water of high quality for drinking and recreation. Normally provided free from a healthy landscape, these can be lost because of the input of large quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus, fine sediment from eroding land, and an increase in water-borne pathogens from farm animals. These impacts of agriculture depend on the proportion of the landscape that is used for production. One small farm – even if there is excessive use of plow, fertilizer and pesticide – will have little effect on biodiversity and water quality in the landscape as a whole. It is the cumulative effects of larger and larger areas of intensive agriculture that deplete the region’s biodiversity and reduce the quality of water needed for other human activities. This suggests that management of agricultural landscapes needs to operate at a regional scale.</p>
<p class="para indent">Santelmann et al. (2004<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0515">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0515</a>-->) integrated the knowledge of experts in environmental, economic, and sociological disciplines into alternative visions of a particular landscape—the catchment area of Walnut Creek, in an intensively farmed part of Iowa. They mapped the present pattern of land use and then created three future management scenarios, assessing how farm income, water quality, and biodiversity would be expected to change under each. A <span class="txt-italic">production</span> scenario imagines what the catchment will look like in 25 years if continued priority is given to corn and soybean production (‘row crops’), following a policy that encourages extension of cultivation to all the highly productive soils available in the catchment. A <span class="txt-italic">water quality</span> scenario envisions a new (hypothetical) federal policy that enforces chemical standards for river and ground water, and supports agricultural practices that reduce soil erosion. Finally, a <span class="txt-italic">biodiversity</span> scenario assumes a new (hypothetical) federal policy to increase the abundance and richness of native plants and animals—in this case a network of biodiversity reserves is established with connecting habitat corridors.</p>

Compared with the current situation, the production scenario produces the most homogeneous landscape, with an increase in row crops and a decrease in the less profitable pasture and forage crops. The water quality scenario leads to more extensive riverbank strips of natural vegetation cover and more perennial crop cover (pasture and forage crops), which are conducive to both higher water quality and biodiversity. Finally, the biodiversity scenario has even wider riverbank strips, together with prairie, forest and wetland reserves, and an increase in ‘strip intercropping,’ a farming practice that reduces soil erosion.<p></p>

The biodiversity scenario also ranks highest in terms of acceptability to farmers (based on farmer ratings of images of land cover under each scenario), and it provides water quality improvements similar in magnitude to those in the water quality scenario. Despite the slightly higher profitability of the production scenario, it seems that the farmers would not be unhappy with a biodiversity strategy that provides the greatest benefits to the community at large in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services.<p></p>

<p class="para">Conservation is the science concerned with increasing the probability that the Earth’s species and communities (or, more generally, its biodiversity) will persist into the future. Biodiversity is, at its most basic, the number of species present, but it can also be viewed at smaller scales (e.g., genetic variation within populations) and larger scales (e.g., the variety of community types present in a region). About 1.8 million species have so far been named, but the real number is probably between 3 and 100 million. The current observed rate of extinction may be as much as 100–1,000 times the background rate indicated by the fossil record.</p>

The extinction of one species may itself pose a threat to further species when chains of extinctions are generated.</p>

<p class="para">Population viability analyses can be valuable in identifying species particularly at risk and in quantifying that risk. Most often, attempts to meet the aims of conservation involve the establishment of protected areas, though these must satisfy a range of criteria that may conflict, including conservation itself, human recreation, and the exploitation of natural resources. Selecting conservation areas is therefore never easy, and even satisfying the need to conserve requires that we consider the quality, size, and connectivity of protected areas, and also we consider areas in groups, not in isolation.</p>

<p class="para">In this chapter, we explore how ecology can help us understand the issues of human population growth, disease, agriculture, and resource use. Human population growth itself has certainly affected the environment and the natural functioning of ecosystems, but equally important are the huge increases in consumption per person and the ever-growing new technologies that support it (<span id="widget-63405" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63405" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.1</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63405"></div>). During the first half of the 20th century, the global population increased by 40%, from 1.8 to 2.5 billion people, but since then the population has almost tripled to over 7 billion. The global gross domestic production also increased by 75% in the first half of the 20th century (from $3 trillion to $5.3 trillion U.S. dollars), but since then it has grown more than 10-fold to $55 trillion. What are the results of this affluence? Increases in consumption of food, energy, and material goods have been massive, with major local and global consequences. The science of ecology can help us understand these consequences and find more sustainable ways to move forward.<p></p>

The United Nations predicts this trend will continue, with two-thirds of the global population living in cities by 2050. In some ways, this trend eases pressures on the environment: per capita greenhouse gas emissions for urban residents tend to be far lower than for the population as a whole, for example. But cities themselves take space, replacing rural landscapes of agricultural and natural ecosystems, and they are sites of concentrated air and water pollution driven by the concentrated use of energy and resources and large quantities of human sewage. Increasing urbanization is made possible by an increasing intensification of agriculture. Fewer people are required to work the fields as agricultural productivity per area increases, fueled by inputs of fertilizer and fossil fuels (for tractors, irrigation, and other uses).<p></p>

Humans will use even more of this NPP in the future, as food consumption increases and more crops are used to produce biofuel energy. Average food consumption per person has increased steadily over the past 50 years, from 2,360 calories per day in the mid-1960s to 2,940 calories today (World Health Organization, 2013). According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, 2,250 calories per day is sufficient for a moderately active adult. Of course, hunger and malnutrition remain major problems in many areas, with perhaps 1 billion people receiving insufficient food. Yet even in developing countries, consumption has increased from 2,054 calories per day in the 1960s to 2,850 today. Why does hunger persist? Presently, hunger results not from inadequate global food production but from unequal distribution. In fact, health authorities are increasingly concerned about overconsumption of food: the global incidence of obesity has doubled over the past 30 years, and more than one-third of adults in the world are now overweight (World Health Organization, 2013). Nonetheless, the global increase in food production is predicted to continue.<p></p>

<p class="para">We can look at human populations of the past to predict future population sizes and rates of growth. But simply projecting forward would be making the almost certainly false assumption that the future will be just like the past. Prediction, in contrast, requires us to <span class="txt-italic">understand</span> what has happened in the past, how the present differs, and how these differences might translate into future patterns of population growth. In particular, we must recognize that like all ecological populations, ours is heterogeneous.</p>
<p class="para indent">We refer to a <span class="txt-bold">demographic transition</span> as a switch from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. We can then recognize three human subpopulations: those that passed through the demographic transition ‘early,’ pre-1945 (<span id="widget-63412" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63412" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63412"></div>), ‘late’ (since 1945), and ‘not yet.’ The pattern is as follows. Initially, both the birth rate and the death rate are high, but the former is only slightly greater than the latter, so the overall rate of population increase is only moderate or small. (We assume this was the case in all human populations in much of the past.) Next, the death rate declines while the birth rate remains high, so the population growth rate increases. Next, however, the birth rate also declines until it is similar to or perhaps even lower than the death rate. The population growth rate eventually declines again (sometimes becoming negative, with death rate higher than birth rate), though with a far larger population than before the transition began.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">The commonly proposed explanation is that transition is an inevitable consequence of industrialization, education, and general modernization, leading first, through medical advances, to the drop in death rates, and then, through the choices people make (such as delaying having children), to the drop in birth rates. Certainly, when we consider all the regional populations of the world together, there has been a dramatic decline from the peak population growth rate of about 2.1% per year in 1965–1970 to around 1.1–1.2% per year today (<span id="widget-63413" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63413" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.5a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63413"></div>).

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">Two future inevitabilities</h2>
<p class="para">Even if it were possible to bring demographic transition to all countries of the world so birth rates equaled death rates and growth were zero, would the ‘population problem’ be solved? No, for at least two important reasons. First, there is a big difference in age structure between a population with equal but high birth and death rates and one in which both are low. We saw in <span id="widget-63414" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63414" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63414"></div> that the net reproductive rate of a population is a reflection of age-related patterns of survival and birth. A given net reproductive rate, though, can be arrived at through a literally infinite number of different birth and death patterns, and these combinations themselves give rise to different age structures within the population. If birth rates are high but survival rates low (‘pre-transition’), there will be many young and relatively few old individuals in the population. But if birth rates are low and survival rates high – the ideal to which we might aspire post-transition – relatively few young, productive individuals must support the many who are old, unproductive, and dependent. The size and growth rates of the human population are not the only problems: the age structure of a population adds yet another (<span id="widget-63415" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63415" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.6</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63415"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Suppose our understanding were so sophisticated, however, and our power so complete, that we could establish equal birth and death rates tomorrow. Would the human population stop growing? The answer, once again, is ‘No.’ Population growth has its own momentum, and even with birth rate matched to death rate, it would take many years to establish a stable age structure, while considerable growth continued in the meantime. According to projections by the United Nations, even with low fertility the world’s population will grow from slightly more than 7 billion today to more than 8 billion by 2050 (<span id="widget-63417" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63417" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.5b</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63417"></div>). There are many more babies in the world now than 25 years ago, so even if birth rate per capita drops considerably now, there will still be many more births in 25 years’ time than now, and these children, in turn, will continue the momentum before an approximately stable age structure is eventually established.

<h2 class="level-2 txt-blue">A global carrying capacity?</h2>
<p class="para">The current rate of increase in the size of the global population is unsustainable even though it is lower now than it has been; in a finite space and with finite resources, no population can continue to grow forever. To suggest an appropriate response, we need some sense of a target, that is, how large a population of humans the Earth can sustain. What is the global carrying capacity? Estimates proposed over the last 300 or so years vary to an astonishing degree, and even those since 1970 span three orders of magnitude—from 1 to 1000 billion. To illustrate the difficulty of arriving at a good estimate, we look at a few examples (see Cohen, <!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0100">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0100</a>-->, 2005, for further details on the authors mentioned below).</p>
<p class="para indent">In 1679, van Leeuwenhoek estimated the inhabited area of the Earth as 13,385 times larger than his home nation of Holland, whose population then was about 1 million people. He assumed all this area could be populated as densely as Holland, yielding an upper limit of roughly 13.4 billion. In 1967, De Wit asked, ‘How many people can live on Earth if photosynthesis is the limiting process?’ His answer—1,000 billion—assumed the growing season varies with latitude, but that neither water nor minerals were limiting. If people wanted to eat meat or have a reasonable amount of living space, De Wit’s estimate would be lower.</p>
<p class="para indent">By contrast, in suggesting a limit of no more than 1 billion, Hulett in 1970 assumed levels of affluence and consumption in the United States were optimal for the whole world, and he included requirements not only for food but also for renewable resources like wood and nonrenewable resources like steel and aluminum. Kates and others, in a series of reports from 1988, made similar assumptions using global rather than United States averages; they estimated a global carrying capacity of 5.9 billion people on a basic diet (principally vegetarian), 3.9 billion on an ‘improved’ diet (about 15% of calories from animal products), or 2.9 billion on a diet with 25% of calories from animal products.</p>
<p class="para indent">More recently, Wackernagel and his colleagues in 2002 sought to quantify the amount of land humans use to supply resources and to absorb wastes (embodied in their ‘ecological footprint’ concept). Their preliminary assessment was that people were using 70% of the biosphere’s capacity in 1961 and 120% by 1999. They reasoned, in other words, that global carrying capacity had been exceeded before the turn of the millennium—when our population was about 6 billion.</p>
<p class="para indent">As Cohen (2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0103">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0103</a>-->) has pointed out, many estimates have been based or rely heavily on a single dimension – biologically productive land area, water, energy, food, and so on—when in reality the impact of one factor depends on the value of others. Thus, for example, if water is scarce and energy is abundant, water can be desalinated and transported to where it is in short supply, a solution that is not available if energy is expensive. And as the examples above make clear, there is a difference between the number the Earth can support and the number it can support at an acceptable standard of living. The higher estimates come closer to the concept of a carrying capacity we normally apply to other organisms (see <span id="widget-63419" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63419" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63419"></div>)—a number imposed by the limiting resources of the environment. But it is unlikely that many of us would choose to live crushed up against an environmental ceiling or wish it on our descendants.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">We are also making a big assumption in implying that the human population is limited from below by its resources rather than from above by its natural enemies. Infectious disease, not long ago considered largely vanquished, is once again perceived as a major threat to human welfare.

Stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, reducing the amount that reaches the surface of the planet where it can cause significant environmental and human-health consequences. Ozone in the stratosphere began to decrease in the 1970s at a rate of 4% per decade. The most dramatic effect was the growing hole in the ozone layer centered over the Antarctic (Shanklin 2010<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0535">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0535</a>-->; <span id="widget-63423" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63423" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.7</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63423"></div></span>), but levels have declined globally.

The Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned chlorofluorocarbons globally as a result and has been hugely helpful in slowing the rate of ozone depletion, but nitrous oxide, which can play a similar role in destroying stratospheric ozone, has been having an increasing effect as its concentrations rise—one of many consequences of the human acceleration of the global nitrogen cycle—and ozone depletion remains a critical issue.<p></p>

Average values are changing—for example, mean global temperatures are rising—but there are also more frequent extreme climate events, as defined by the international Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI): heat waves, floods, droughts, high winds, and so on. Past patterns and forward projections are shown for one extreme event in <span id="widget-63427" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63427" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.9</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63427"></div></span>: the annual number of ‘tropical nights’ in Europe, when temperatures remain above 20°C (68°F), indicative of heat wave conditions. To validate the forward projections, the output of the chosen climate model (shown in <span id="widget-63428" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63428" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.9</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63428"></div></span>) was first compared with observed values up to the present. The correspondence was good. The same model was then used to project forward on the basis of two contrasting scenarios proposed by the International Panel on Climate Change. Model B1 imagines a rapid switch to a less production-intensive economy and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies; model A1B stays much closer to the current status quo. But both scenarios predict still further acceleration in the number of tropical nights in southern and central Europe, and even in northern Europe by the end of the century.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Most likely to be affected are vector-borne diseases like malaria, since the vectors themselves, often insects, are especially at the mercy of environmental temperatures because they are ectotherms (see <span id="widget-63431" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63431" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 3.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63431"></div>). They will be affected not only by average temperatures but by the even more uncertain daily and yearly patterns. The effects of climate on vectors are complex, and our knowledge of even the most important ones is far from complete. Clearly we must be cautious, especially as earlier suggestions of massive range expansions have tended to be superseded by more modest predictions, as shown, for example, for malaria in <span id="widget-63432" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63432" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63432"></div></span>.

<section class="section-5" id="c14-sec-0015">
<p class="para">The overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture and medicine is putting human lives at unnecessary risk and driving up medical costs, according to a group of 150 scientists that includes a former head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Along with 50 U.S. farmers and ranchers who have opted out of using non-therapeutic antibiotics in their animal feed, the scientists are calling on the FDA and Congress to work together to regulate unnecessary use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. In twin statements released on Wednesday, the scientists and farmers said that a growing body of research supported the conclusion that overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture is fueling a health crisis. One statement cited a study which estimated that antibiotic-resistant infections cost $20bn annually to hospitals alone.</p>
<p class="para indent">Donald Kennedy, former FDA commissioner and president emeritus at Stanford University, said: ‘There’s no question that routinely administering non-therapeutic doses of antibiotics to food animals contributes to antibiotic resistance.’ Kennedy said the FDA’s current voluntary approach, which asks the animal drug industry to stop selling antibiotics medically important to human disease as growth promoters in animal feed, was not enough. Kennedy, who was also former editor-in-chief of <span class="txt-italic">Science</span> magazine for eight years, said: ‘Unless it reaches the industry as a regulatory requirement it will not be taken seriously.’ Three decades after the FDA determined that growth-promoting uses of penicillin and tetracycline in agriculture were threatening human health, its own data show that 80% of all antimicrobial drugs sold nationally are used in animal agriculture.</p>
<p class="para indent">Louise Slaughter, a Democratic Representative for New York who is a microbiologist, joined the scientists and others in calling for regulation of animal agriculture’s use of non-therapeutic antibiotics. At a press conference organised by the Union of Concerned Scientists to launch the statement, she compared agriculture’s use of antibiotics in animal feed to mothers sprinkling them on their children’s cereal every morning. Antibiotic-resistant diseases now kill more Americans than HIV/Aids, Slaughter said. ‘Every year, more than 100,000 Americans die from bacterial infections acquired in hospitals, and seventy percent of these infections are resistant to drugs commonly used to treat them. This abuse and overuse must stop.’</p>
<p class="para indent">The scientists said that while the medical community had ‘stepped up to the plate’ by educating doctors and reducing prescriptions, the agriculture industry was lagging behind. They said that while the principal linking antibiotic resistance and non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics was widely accepted, antibiotics are still routinely added in massive quantities to animal feed, not to treat disease but to promote faster growth and to stave off diseases caused by poor diets and raising animals in overcrowded unsanitary living conditions.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">The scientific community has understood the risk of feeding antibiotics to livestock for well over 40 years. Why has the practice persisted? How might scientists better communicate their concerns to the public and politicians?</span></p>

<p class="para">The huge increase in the global population would not have been possible without an equally huge intensification in agricultural production. For most of the history of our species—since humans evolved 300,000 years ago—all people were hunter-gatherers, obtaining their food by harvesting natural populations of animals and plants. The first global increase in human population could occur only with the development of agriculture, beginning in many parts of the world independently some 10,000 years ago. Plants and animals were domesticated and, through gradual experimentation over centuries and millennia, humans increased their productivity, allowing our population densities to rise.</p>
<p class="para indent">For much of the past 10,000 years, the global human population has been regulated by the supply of food, by disease, and by war. The rate of food production was central, since shortages contribute greatly to disease and war. Providing a larger and more secure food supply has been critical for all civilizations, and a major focus of science throughout the modern era. With the discovery by 19th-century German chemist Justus von Liebig (see <span id="widget-63435" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63435" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 11.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63435"></div>) that nitrogen often limited agricultural productivity, the search was on for ways to find more nitrogen to support increased production. Until the 20th century, much of this came from nitrogen fixation by bacterial symbionts of plants such as alfalfa, clover, soybeans, and peanuts (all classified as leguminous). The mining of guano—the accumulated feces and urine of birds in rich deposits—on islands such as those off the shores of Peru and Chile also provided a nitrogen-rich fertilizer that was widely used from the 1700s well into the 20th century.<p></p>

</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Before synthetic nitrogen fertilizer became readily available, the return to crop fields of the nitrogen-rich manure wastes of the livestock was critical. Manure is wet and heavy, and therefore difficult and expensive to transport, mandating that the livestock were raised near the crop fields or allowed to graze directly in pastures. But with relatively cheap synthetic fertilizer, farmers no longer needed animal wastes. It became more economically efficient to feed animals in concentrated feedlots, often far from the crop fields, and simply dispose of the manure as waste. These feedlot operations became a source of nitrogen pollution of both water and air (ammonia gas volatilizes to the atmosphere), in addition to nitrogen pollution from crop fields that produce grain fed to the animals.</p>
<p class="para indent">The trend toward a spatial segregation of crop production and animal production began in the United States after the Second World War and accelerated rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s. This allowed an intensification of animal agriculture that supported a large increase in the consumption of meat. Per capita meat consumption in the United States rose by 60% to a little over 70 kg per year between 1950 and 1970 and has remained fairly constant since then. Of course, total consumption for the nation has continued to grow as the population has grown.</p>

<p class="para indent">Recognizing that meat consumption and the intensification of animal agriculture cause significant environmental damage, a group of ecologists and biogeochemists in 2009 passed the “Barsac Declaration,” urging everyone in the world to obtain no more than 35 to 40% of their protein from meat (Billen et al., 2012<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0048">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0048</a>-->). This “demitarian” diet would reduce by half the meat now consumed by citizens of the United States and western Europe, is in line with what physicians recommend as an upper limit, and roughly equals the global average, although regional variations exist (<span id="widget-63442" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63442" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.13a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63442"></div>). As an example of how much this could reduce nitrogen pollution, consider the case of Paris: if every Parisian were to convert to the demitarian diet and primarily eat organic food, nitrogen pollution in the Seine River would decrease by more than half. Although the reduction in meat consumption is a critical part of this reduction, replacing food grown with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with organic food helps, as less nitrogen leaches from the organic agricultural fields per unit of crop harvested (Billen et al., 2012<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0048">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0048</a>-->).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Nitrogen losses from conventional agriculture can also be significantly reduced simply by using less fertilizer. In the “corn belt” of the upper Midwestern United States—the source both of most of the corn grown in the United States and of most of the nitrogen flowing down the Mississippi River to fuel the large hypoxic “dead zone” in the northern Gulf of Mexico—farmers routinely use more fertilizer than makes economic sense. They would save money by buying and using less fertilizer, since their crop yields and gross sales would remain as high (<span id="widget-63443" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63443" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.14</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63443"></div>), and the nitrogen leaching to surface waters would go down, since again this surplus nitrogen is not taken up by the crop and is readily leached. Why do farmers waste their money on this overfertilization? The answer seems to be that economic cost (if one does not include the environmental damage from the nitrogen pollution!) is relatively low, and so farmers use the extra fertilizer hoping that an above-average year climatically (perfect temperatures and rainfall) may lead to an extremely bountiful harvest. If farmers used even a little less synthetic nitrogen fertilizer than recommended for their maximum economic return, the resulting nitrogen pollution could be reduced greatly with only slight reductions in crop yields (<span id="widget-63444" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63444" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.14</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63444"></div></span>).

<p class="para indent">Agricultural scientists have developed many other tools for reducing downstream nitrogen pollution from agriculture. For instance, a winter cover crop is a secondary crop (for example rye) planted in the fall and harvested in the following spring before again planting the primary crop of economic value (for example corn). In the temperate zone, soil nitrate concentrations in the spring are often very high due to continuous low-level bacterial mineralization and lack of plant assimilation over the winter. This soil nitrate can be assimilated, though, by cover crops in early spring; otherwise, the snowmelt and rains of spring carry the nitrates away downstream. Another approach is to treat soils with substances that inhibit nitrification (see <span id="widget-63445" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63445" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 11.26</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63445"></div>); ammonium is readily adsorbed onto soil particles and is far less likely to be leached to downstream waters than nitrate, so preventing the conversion to nitrate reduces nitrogen pollution.<p></p>

<p class="para indent">To what extent is the monoculture method sustainable? There is abundant evidence of its high price. For example, monocultures offer ideal conditions for the epidemic spread of diseases such as swine fever among livestock and coccidiosis among poultry. In addition, high rates of transmission between herds occur as animals are sold from one farming enterprise to another. The dramatic spread of foot and mouth disease among British livestock in 2001 and again in 2007 provides a graphic example.</p>
<p class="para indent">Crop plants, too, illustrate the fragility of human dependence on monocultures. The potato, native to the Americas, was introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, and three centuries later it had become the almost exclusive food crop of Ireland’s poor. Dense monoculture provided ideal conditions for the devastating spread of late blight (the fungal pathogen <span class="txt-italic">Phytophthora infestans</span>) in the 1840s, dramatically reducing potato yields and decomposing the tubers in storage. Of a population of about 8 million, 1.1 million Irish died in the resulting famine and another 1.5 million emigrated to the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p class="para indent">An outbreak of southern corn leaf blight (caused again by a fungus, <span class="txt-italic">Helminthosporium maydis</span>) developed in the southeastern United States in the late 1960s and spread rapidly after 1970.

<section class="section-3" id="c14-sec-0017">
<p class="para">In June 2005, Dan Koeppel filed the story below.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote">For nearly everyone in the US, Canada and Europe, a banana is a banana: yellow and sweet, uniformly sized, firmly textured, always seedless.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">The Cavendish banana—as the slogan of Chiquita, the globe’s largest banana producer, declares – is ‘quite possibly the world’s perfect food’…. It also turns out that the 100 billion Cavendish bananas consumed annually worldwide are perfect from a genetic standpoint, every single one a duplicate of every other. It doesn’t matter if it comes from Honduras or Thailand, Jamaica or the Canary Islands – each Cavendish is an identical twin to one first found in Southeast Asia, brought to a Caribbean botanic garden in the early part of the 20th century, and put into commercial production about 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">That sameness is the banana’s paradox. After 15,000 years of human cultivation, the banana is too perfect, lacking the genetic diversity that is key to species health. What can ail one banana can ail all. A fungus or bacterial disease that infects one plantation could march around the globe and destroy millions of bunches, leaving supermarket shelves empty.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">A wild scenario? Not when you consider that there’s already been one banana apocalypse. Until the early 1960s, American cereal bowls and ice cream dishes were filled with the Gros Michel, a banana that was larger and, by all accounts, tastier than the fruit we now eat. Like the Cavendish, the Gros Michel, or ‘Big Mike’, accounted for nearly all the sales of sweet bananas in the Americas and Europe.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">But starting in the early part of the last century, a fungus called Panama disease began infecting the Big Mike harvest. It appeared first in Suriname, then plowed through the Caribbean, finally reaching Honduras in the 1920s. By 1960, the major importers were nearly bankrupt, and the future of the fruit was in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">The Cavendish was eventually accepted as Big Mike’s replacement after billions of dollars in infrastructure changes were made to accommodate different growing and ripening needs. Its advantage was its resistance to Panama disease. But in 1992, a new strain of the fungus - one that can affect the Cavendish - was discovered in Asia. Since then, Panama disease Race 4 has wiped out plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan, and it is now spreading through much of Southeast Asia. It has yet to hit Africa or Latin America, but most experts agree that it is coming.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">A global effort is now under way to save the fruit - an effort defined by two opposing visions of how best to address the looming crisis. On one side are traditional banana growers, who raise experimental breeds in the fields, trying to create a replacement plant that looks and tastes so similar to the Cavendish that consumers won’t notice the difference. On the other side are bioengineers, who, armed with a largely decoded banana genome, are manipulating the plant’s chromosomes, sometimes crossing them with DNA from other species, with the goal of inventing a tougher Cavendish that will resist Panama disease and other ailments.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote indent">Currently, there is no way to effectively combat Panama disease and no Cavendish replacement in sight. And so traditional scientists and geneticists are in a race - against one another, for certain, but mostly against time.</p>

Biomagnification occurs when a pesticide is present in an organism that becomes the prey of another, and the predator fails to excrete or metabolize the pesticide. It then accumulates in the body of the predator. The predator may itself be eaten by a further predator, and the insecticide becomes ever more concentrated as it passes up the food chain. Top predators, never intended as targets, can then accumulate extraordinarily high doses, sometimes with lethal effects.<p></p>

<span class="figure-caption block">Organochlorines, applied as pesticides on land, are transported to the Arctic through river runoff and oceanic and atmospheric circulation. A study in the Barents Sea showed how two classes of pesticide are biomagnified during passage through the marine food chain. Concentrations in sea water are very low. Herbivorous copepods (that feed on phytoplankton) have higher concentrations (measured in nanograms per gram of lipid in the organisms), and predatory amphipods higher concentrations still. The polar cod (<span class="txt-italic">Boreogadus saida</span>), which feeds on the invertebrates, and cod (<span class="txt-italic">Gadus morhua</span>), which also includes polar cod in its diet, show further evidence of biomagnification. However, it is the higher steps in the food chain where biomagnification is most marked, because the sea birds that feed on the fish (black guillemots, <span class="txt-italic">Cepphus grylle</span>) or on fish and other sea birds (glaucous gull, <span class="txt-italic">Larus hyperboreus</span>) have much less ability to eliminate the chemicals than fish or invertebrates. Note how chlordanes are biomagnified to a lesser extent than polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This results from the birds’ greater ability to metabolize and excrete the former class of pesticide. <span class="source">(Based on data in Borga et al., 2001<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0057">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0057</a>-->.)</span></span>

<p class="para indent">The peregrine falcon (<span class="txt-italic">Falco peregrinus</span>) is a particularly distinctive and beautiful bird of prey with an almost worldwide range. Until the 1940s, about 500 pairs bred regularly in the eastern states of the United States and about 1,000 pairs in the west and in Mexico. In the late 1940s their numbers started a rapid decline, and by the mid-1970s the bird had disappeared from almost all the eastern states and its numbers had fallen by 80 to 90% in the west. Similar dramatic declines were occurring in Europe. Peregrine falcons were listed as an <span class="txt-italic">endangered species</span>, at risk of extinction. The decline, which occurred in many other birds of prey, was traced to failure to hatch normal broods and very high breakage of eggs in the nest.</p>
<p class="para indent">The cause was eventually identified as the accumulation of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in the parent birds.

In Britain, recovery has been so successful that the peregrine is regarded as a pest by pigeon fanciers and lovers of smaller songbirds. The use of DDT as an agricultural pesticide continued in some developing countries until it was banned globally in 2001 by the Stockholm Convention, but it is still allowed for controlling populations of insects that carry diseases such as malaria.<p></p>

<p class="para">Rachel Carson (1907–1964) was a U.S. ecologist and author (<span id="widget-63455" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63455" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.18</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63455"></div>). After completing a master’s degree in zoology, she was forced to quit her graduate studies in 1935 to support her mother when her father died. She took a temporary job with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing the script for a weekly radio show on marine ecology. She excelled at this and in 1936 landed a regular position with the bureau as a professional aquatic biologist, becoming the second woman ever to have such a job there. Carson stayed with the bureau through its reconfiguration as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service following World War II, and as part of her work, in 1945 she began to look into the ecological effects of the then-new insecticide DDT.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">By 1949, Carson had become the chief editor of publications for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and had published several articles on nature and ecology for the general public. Finding her government work tedious, she left and became an independent writer, publishing several pieces over the next decade including the widely praised books <span class="txt-italic">The Sea Around Us</span> (1950) and <span class="txt-italic">The Edge of the Sea</span> (1955). These still make excellent reads.</p>
<p class="para indent">Carson became increasingly involved in the conservation movement and was quite alarmed by the introduction into nature of exotic chemicals such as DDT. In 1962, she published <span class="txt-italic">Silent Spring</span>, documenting the destructive potential of carelessly used pesticides on natural ecosystems and human health. Carson solicited expert review of her chapters before publication, and her work was very well received by environmental scientists. However, she and the book were savagely attacked by the chemical industry and industry-connected scientists.</p>
<p class="para indent"><span class="txt-italic">Silent Spring</span> was a game changer. Public attention to the use of synthetic pesticides was galvanized, leading to the banning of DDT, first in the United States in the early 1970s and eventually throughout the world as of 2001. The book also contributed to the birth of the modern environmental movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s. More than a decade after her death, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter.</p>

<p class="para indent">A pesticide gets a bad name if, as is often the case, it kills more species than the one at which it is aimed, and especially if it kills the pest’s natural enemies and so contributes to undoing what it was employed to do. <span class="glossaryTerm" id="c14-tdef-0005" title="when treatment (typically with a chemical pesticide) affects a pest’s natural enemies such that upon removal of the treatment, and in the continued absence of the natural enemies, the pest reaches even higher abundances than those before the treatment" role="link" tabindex="0" href="javascript:;" aria-label="glossary - Target pest resurgence">Target pest resurgence</span> occurs when treatment kills large numbers of the pest <span class="txt-italic">and</span> its natural enemies. Pest individuals that survive the pesticide or migrate into the area later therefore find themselves with a plentiful food resource and few natural enemies. The pest population may then explode.</p>
<p class="para indent">A pesticide can cause even more subtle reactions by destroying the enemies of potential pest species that had otherwise been kept below their EILs. These now become real, “secondary,” pests released from natural control (see <span id="widget-63457" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63457" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.15c</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63457"></div>). In 1950, when mass dissemination of organic insecticides began, there were two primary pests on cotton in Central America: the Alabama leafworm and the boll weevil (Smith, 1998<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0549">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0549</a>-->). Organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides were applied fewer than five times a year and initially had apparently miraculous results – crop yields soared. By 1955, however, three new types of pests had emerged: the cotton bollworm, the cotton aphid, and the false pink bollworm. In response, farmers increased pesticide applications to 8 to 10 times per year. This reduced the aphid and the false pink bollworm, but it led to the emergence of another five pests. By the 1960s, the original two pest species had become eight, and there were, on average, 28 applications of insecticide per year.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Chemical pesticides lose their value if the targeted pests evolve resistance. This natural selection in action (see <span id="widget-63458" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63458" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63458"></div>) is almost certain to occur when vast numbers of a genetically variable population are killed. One or a few individuals may be unusually resistant (perhaps because they possess an enzyme that can detoxify the pesticide). If the pesticide is applied repeatedly, each successive generation of the pest will contain a larger proportion of resistant individuals. Pests typically have a high intrinsic rate of reproduction, so a few individuals in one generation may give rise to hundreds or thousands in the next, and resistance spreads very rapidly in a population. The same processes are at work when bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics, something greatly favored by the routine feeding of antibiotics to healthy animals in feedlot operations (<span id="widget-63459" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63459" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 14.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63459"></div></span>).<p></p>

</aside>
<p class="para indent">If chemical pesticides brought nothing but problems, they would already have fallen out of widespread use. Instead, their rate of production has increased rapidly. Farmers find the cost of buying and spraying the pesticides to be worth the savings in reduced damage to crops. In many poorer countries, the prospect of mass starvation or epidemic disease is so frightening that the social and health costs of pesticides have to be ignored. Their use is generally justified by objective measures such as lives saved, economic efficiency of food production, and total food produced. In this very fundamental sense, their use may be described as sustainable. In practice, sustainability depends on continually developing new pesticides that keep at least one step ahead of the pests—and that are less persistent, biodegradable, and more accurately targeted.</p>

<p class="para indent">The classic example is the story of the cottony cushion scale insect (<span class="txt-italic">Icerya purchasi</span>), discovered as a pest of Californian citrus orchards in 1868. By 1886 it had brought the citrus industry to its knees. A search for natural enemies led to the importation from Australia and New Zealand of two candidate species. The first was a parasitoid, a two-winged fly (<span class="txt-italic">Cryptochaetum</span> sp.) that laid its eggs on the scale insect, giving rise to a larva that consumed the pest. The other was a predatory ladybird beetle (<span class="txt-italic">Rodolia cardinalis</span>). Initially, the parasitoids seemed to have disappeared, but the predatory beetles underwent such a population explosion that, amazingly, all scale insect infestations in California were controlled by the end of 1890.

<p class="para">The global production of agricultural crops tripled in the decades between 1961 and 2008, though with less than a 10% increase in the area of cropland farmed (<span id="widget-63463" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63463" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.21a</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63463"></div>). This statistic masks some important regional differences: the cropland area of Eastern Europe and Russia fell, as did that in the United States to a lesser extent, while Latin America, Asia, Oceania, and Africa all saw increases in the area of land farmed for crops. Still, thanks to high population growth, the area of cropland farmed per capita globally fell by 50% (<span id="widget-63464" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63464" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.21b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63464"></div></span>). The increase in food production was driven by agricultural intensification, particularly the use of nitrogen fertilizer, but also by increased use of fossil fuels for tractors and combines, greater efforts to control pests, increased irrigation, and breeding of inherently more productive crops. Can production continue to increase?<p></p>

Already, the Nile in Africa, the Yellow River in China, and the Colorado River in North America dry up for at least part of the year, with dramatic consequences for the downstream coastal waters.

<p class="para indent">Around 300 million hectares of soil around the world are now severely degraded, unable to continue to support productive agriculture because of nutrient exhaustion, salt buildup, or other problems. A further 1.2 billion hectares—10% of the Earth’s vegetated surface—are moderately degraded. Clearly much of agricultural practice has not been sustainable. Land without soil can support only very small primitive organisms, such as lichens and mosses that can cling onto a rock surface. The rest of the world’s terrestrial vegetation has to be rooted in soil, which gives it physical support and supplies roots with essential mineral nutrients and water during plant growth. Soil develops by the accumulation of finely divided mineral products of rock weathering and decomposing organic residues from previous vegetation. It can be lost by being washed or blown away, perhaps to be redeposited as fine-textured <span class="txt-italic">loess</span> somewhere else. Soil is best protected when it contains organic matter, is always wholly covered with vegetation, is finely interwoven with roots and rootlets, and is on horizontal ground. Generally, when natural ecosystems are converted to cropland, the soil is degraded to at least some extent. Dramatic evidence of unsustainable land use comes from the “Dust Bowl” disaster in the Great Plains of the United States, and a similar disaster happening now in China (<span id="widget-63466" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63466" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 14.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63466"></div>).<p></p>

A 2010 letter to the U.S. President from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, an umbrella organization representing 1.4 million scientists in the United States, argued that while addressing global warming was critical, some “solutions” had received insufficient scientific scrutiny, noting particularly the production of liquid biofuels from corn, and the development of natural gas from shale using high-volume hydraulic fracturing (see <span id="widget-63475" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63475" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 12.2</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63475"></div>).

<p class="para">a closer look at ethanol</p>
</div>
</aside>
<p class="para indent">Biofuels supply 13% of global energy, but less than 1% is from liquid biofuels. The global use of biomass is dominated by combustion of solid forms, wood, and animal waste; dried dung makes up 5% of all global energy use. Virtually all the ethanol in the world is now produced from crops that can also be used for food; corn in the United States is the largest source globally, followed by sugar cane in Brazil. In 2007, the United States used 24% of its corn harvest to produce 1.3% of the total liquid fuel supply for the country (gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products made up the rest). Ethanol production has grown since then, consuming 40% of the U.S. corn harvest in 2012 but still producing only a very small percentage of the nation’s energy.</p>
<p class="para indent">The process of making ethanol from these crops is inherently inefficient, particularly for corn. Corn itself is an energy-intensive crop to grow, and half the energy content of the harvest is lost during fermentation to produce ethanol. Large amounts of energy from coal or natural gas are needed to distill the ethanol into an anhydrous (water-free) form that can be mixed with gasoline. Per unit of land, we can generate nine times more energy by instead growing perennial grasses and burning them to coproduce heat and electricity. The land requirement is of course critical, given an impending shortage of global land for agriculture.</p>
<p class="para indent">Ethanol causes more air pollution than gasoline and also leads to high levels of water pollution, in Brazil from the wastes of fermentation, and in the United States from growing the corn. The United States has a national policy to reduce the nitrogen flows down the Mississippi River by 45% and to reduce the size of the dead zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico (<span id="widget-63476" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63476" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 1.4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63476"></div>, and <span id="widget-63477" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63477" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 11</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63477"></div></span>), yet several studies conclude that the national policy to produce more ethanol from corn will actually increase this nitrogen pollution by 30% or more.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">Ethanol as a fuel may also aggravate greenhouse gas emissions more than fossil fuels; it certainly has a larger greenhouse gas footprint than renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

As more of the U.S. corn harvest is used to produce ethanol, less corn is available for food or livestock feed. In response, the demand for animal feeds grown elsewhere has increased, in particular for soybeans grown in the Cerrado region of Brazil (a large area of tropical savanna; see <span id="widget-63478" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63478" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Chapter 4</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63478"></div>).

<p class="para">Is there a difference between obtaining food by farming and by fishing? Farms and herds tend to be owned and managed by a farmer or organization. In contrast, most of the ocean waters that are fished have at one time been common property, leaving them open to potentially unsustainable looting by all comers. Over the past 50 years, though, fishing has come under increasing national and international regulation and national claims to ‘“ownership”, though this has not necessarily led to good management, as we shall see. The global catch of wild fish has remained steady for most of the past 25 years, perhaps even declining in the past decade (<span id="widget-63481" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63481" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.27</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63481"></div>).

But harvesters also want to avoid underexploitation; if fewer individuals are removed than the population can bear, the harvested crop is smaller than necessary, potential consumers are deprived, and those who do the harvesting are underemployed. It is not easy to tread the narrow path between under- and overexploitation. It is asking a great deal of a management policy to combine the well-being of the exploited species, the profitability of the harvesting enterprise, continuing employment for the workforce, and the maintenance of traditional lifestyles, social customs, and natural biodiversity.<p></p>

If the population stayed exactly at the peak of its net recruitment curve (and that is a big if), this could work: each year the population, through growth and reproduction, would add exactly what harvesting removed. But if by chance numbers fell even slightly below those at which the curve peaked (say because a year’s bad weather led to lower recruitment), then the numbers harvested would exceed those recruited. Population size would decline below the peak of the curve, and if we maintained a fixed quota at the MSY level, the population would decline until it was extinct. If we even slightly overestimated the MSY (and reliable estimates are hard to come by), the harvesting rate would always exceed the recruitment rate and extinction would again follow. In short, a fixed quota at the MSY level might be desirable and reasonable in a wholly predictable world about which we had perfect knowledge. But in the real world of fluctuating environments and imperfect data sets, these fixed quotas are open invitations to disaster.<p></p>

From 1960 to 1972 this was the world’s largest single fishery, and a major sector of the Peruvian economy. Fisheries experts advised that the MSY was around 10 million tons annually, and catches were limited accordingly. But the fishing capacity of the fleet expanded, and in 1972 the catch crashed. Overfishing seems, at the least, to have been a major cause, although its effects were compounded by profound environmental fluctuations, discussed below. A moratorium on fishing would have been an ecologically sensible step, but this was not politically feasible: 20,000 people were dependent on the anchovy industry for employment. The Peruvian government therefore allowed fishing to continue. The stock took more than 20 years to recover.<p></p>

By 1973, however, commercial fishing had so greatly increased that the next El Niño event had even more severe consequences. There were some signs of recovery from 1973 to 1982, but a further collapse occurred in 1983 with yet another El Niño event. While it is unlikely the events would have had such severe effects if the anchovy had been only lightly fished, it is clear that the history of the Peruvian anchovy fishery cannot be explained simply in terms of overfishing.<p></p>

Also, recruitment in practice is a complex process incorporating adult survival, adult fecundity, juvenile survival, juvenile growth, and so on, each of which may respond in its own way to changes in density and harvesting strategy. One model that takes some of these variables into account was developed for the Arcto-Norwegian cod fishery, the most northerly fish stock in the Atlantic Ocean. The numbers of fish in different age classes were known for the late 1960s and this information was used to predict the tonnage of fish likely to be caught with different intensities of harvesting and net mesh sizes. The model predicted that the long-term prospects for the fishery were best ensured with a low intensity of fishing (less than 30%) and a large mesh size.

In 475 <span class="sc">BC</span>, Fan Lai published a book entitled <span class="txt-italic">The Classic of Fish Culture</span> on the production of domesticated carp in fish ponds in China, characterizing an enterprise that probably started at least 4,000 years ago (FAO, 2012<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0166">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0166</a>-->). However, aquaculture on the scale practiced today began in the second half of the 20th century, essentially the same time as the intensification of agriculture. Fish, particularly freshwater species such as carp and tilapia, but also marine species such as salmon, are the largest products of aquaculture (<span id="widget-63495" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63495" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.34a</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63495"></div></span>). The production of algae (used in many food products, as agar in desserts, and as a thickening agent, as well as the rolled algae in sushi), of molluscs (mussels, oysters, clams), and of crustaceans (shrimp) has been on the rise. Most aquaculture occurs in Asia, particularly China (<span id="widget-63496" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63496" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Figure 14.34b</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63496"></div></span>).<p></p>

<p class="para indent">Aquaculture now provides a globally important source of food and protein, but it has also attracted attention for adverse environmental consequences. One problem is the loss of coastal mangrove swamps: the mangroves are frequently cut and the swamps converted to aquaculture ponds, particularly for shrimp culture, creating a leading cause of wetland loss globally. Although the operators of shrimp ponds profit, the external costs of wetland loss are greater and are borne by society, for instance through losses of native fish species (Gunawardena &amp; Rowan, 2005<!--<a class="link" href="http://vmgetoolprod.wiley.com/download/eBook/begon9780470909133/b01/begon9780470909133b01_NC.html#b01-bib-0220">Missing File: External link tobegon9780470909133b01:b01-bib-0220</a>-->). Some aquaculture species, particularly salmon, are commonly fed wild-caught food as a major part of their diet. This is essential to produce salmon that are healthy for humans to consume (<span id="widget-63497" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63497" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 14.6</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63497"></div>), but the result is a net loss of fish protein, since the biomass of the salmon produced is less than the biomass of the fish they consume, a necessary result of food-chain efficiencies (see <span id="widget-63498" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63498" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 11.5</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63498"></div></span>). Because fish and shellfish are highly concentrated in aquaculture operations, high levels of nutrient pollution often result. Further, as in animal feeding operations (see <span id="widget-63499" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63499" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Box 14.2</span><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63499"></div></span>), fish and shellfish in aquaculture are commonly fed antibiotics to encourage growth and reduce bacterial infections.<p></p>

<section class="section-3" id="c14-sec-0024">
<p class="para">A 2008 report in the online Science Daily led off with the headline ‘Popular Fish, Tilapia, Contains Potentially Dangerous Fatty Acid Combination’ (Wake Forest University, 2008). The article went on: “Farm-raised tilapia, one of the most highly consumed fish in America, has very low levels of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and, perhaps worse, very high levels of omega-6 fatty acids, according to new research from Wake Forest University School of Medicine. The researchers say the combination could be a potentially dangerous food source for some patients with heart disease, arthritis, asthma and other allergic and auto-immune diseases that are particularly vulnerable to an ‘exaggerated inflammatory response.’ Inflammation is known to cause damage to blood vessels, the heart, lung and joint tissues, skin, and the digestive tract.”</p>
<p class="para indent">The article received widespread attention, since one of the major reasons many people eat fish is to consume omega-3 fatty acids for their health benefits.</p>
<p class="para indent">Why do the tilapia have more of the adverse omega-6 fatty acids, and less of the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids? Fish do not produce their own fatty acids but rather biomagnify the fatty acids in their foods, just as animals biomagnify pesticides and other toxins (<span id="widget-63500" class="widget link-widget link" style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; margin-left: 0px; background: transparent; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span id="link_63500" role="link" href="javascript:;" tabindex="0" aria-label="" class="widget-content" title="" style="cursor:pointer;">Section 14.5</span></span></p><div class="widget-toggle-menu" widgetid="63500"></div>). Algae are high in the omega-3 acids, so tilapia feeding on algae (as they do in the wild) are very high in these as well. Tilapia fed on corn or soybean, which are low in the omega-3 fatty acids and high in the omega-6 ones, are the problem.<p></p>
<p class="para indent">A similar problem results when salmon are provided with foods with the ‘wrong’ fatty acids. This is one reason that cultured salmon are commonly fed wild-caught fish, in addition to feeds that contain corn and soybeans. Further, more than half the world’s production of fish oil from wild-caught fish is fed to salmon in aquaculture.</p>
<p class="para txt-blockquote"><span class="txt-italic">Tilapia can eat practically any plant or algae species. Should those who grow tilapia in aquaculture be encouraged to use algae as a food, so the fish will have more of the beneficial fatty acids, and less of the undesirable ones? Should fish foods based on corn or soybean be augmented with fish oils, to increase the desirable fatty acids? What are the benefits and problems of this approach?</span></p>

<p class="para">Biogeochemical changes to the global ecosystem cause a variety of health problems. Loss of protective ozone from the stratosphere, caused by man-made chemicals such as CFCs or increased concentrations of natural products such as nitrous oxide, is leading to increased penetration of UV radiation and higher incidence of skin cancers. Increasingly frequent extreme climate effects accompanying global warming account for many additional deaths and even more hospitalizations each year. Global climate change is heightening the incidence and distribution of existing human infectious diseases; these and other human influences are leading to a rise in the number of new infections, many of them zoonotic.</p>

<p class="para">Increased use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has intensified agriculture and allowed the spatial segregation of concentrated animal agriculture from the fields, which grow the crops to feed the animals. Meat consumption has risen globally and in many countries, requiring more crop production and creating large amounts of animal wastes. Diets less rich in meat can reduce pollution from agriculture and are already recommended in many Western countries, where current consumption levels adversely affect health. Excessive fertilization of croplands also contributes significantly to nitrogen pollution.</p>

<p class="para">The intensification of agriculture is based on crop monocultures susceptible to pest outbreaks. Heavy use of chemical pesticides after the Second World War sometimes killed predators, allowing rapid growth of novel pests. Some pesticides such as DDT can be biomagnified, leading to damage in nontarget species, including birds. Another problem is the ability of pests to rapidly evolve resistance to chemical pesticides. Biological approaches to pest control offer many advantages, as does integrated pest management, a pragmatic approach that combines some use of chemicals with biological controls.</p>

<p class="para">The huge increase in agricultural production over the past 50 years was based on a continuous increase in yield per area farmed, but further increases will be limited by constraints such as inadequate water for irrigation and adverse effects of global climate change and air pollution. Further, some cropland becomes degraded through salinization or is lost to urban encroachment. The increased production of liquid biofuels also requires land. There may not be sufficient land available globally to meet the future demand for agricultural production of food and biofuels.</p>

<p class="para indent">The global catch of fish has remained stagnant for several decades. Aquaculture, on the other hand, has expanded greatly over the past two decades and is an increasingly important source of protein globally. Like land-based agriculture, however, it poses significant environmental challenges.</p>
