Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.69)You are the Director of HR at Targus Inc., a Canadian sportswear retailer with 1000 employees. Discuss reasonswhy you would choose to implement a stand-alone system rather than an enterprise-wide system.Answer:An HRIS can be a stand-along system, because not all organizations require sophisticatedenterprise-wide systems such as SAP or Oracle. The reasons that would drive an organization to decideon a stand-alone system would be cost, number of employees, the degree of efficiency and the company'sexisting hardware and software.An effective HRIS requires a balance between what it can do from a technical perspective and how it canmeet the needs of that organization. These needs usually tend to increase as the size of the companygrows. Smaller firms typically use very basic software applications such as MS Excel. In addition, smallerfirms are not able to bear the large costs associated with implementing an enterprise-wide system, norwould this be cost effective, since smaller firms would require payroll and benefits administration,time/attendance and employee scheduling functions right from the start. As the size of the companygrows, the data integration requirement grows and, with it, the need to have better backup and recoverycapability. Therefore larger organizations will want to invest in enterprise-wide systems.70)Describe the stages in the evolution of HR technology.Answer:There are four stages in the evolution of HR technology: paper-based systems, early personal computertechnology, electronic databases and web-based technology.Stage 1–Paper-based systemsThese systems operated independently from other business-related functions. Data was typically storedon mainframe computers and HR was the sole custodian of the data. It was common for managers tosend employees to HR to get their \"personnel\" questions answered.Stage 2–Early personal computer technologyIn this stage data migrated to PCs and local area network systems. These databases were able to producereports that listed basic employee information. HR continued to be the only group who had access to thesystem and continued to be the owner of the data.Stage 3–Electronic database systemsRelational database technology emerged in this stage, which meant that pieces of data could be stored inmore than one file, and they could be connected. With this, HR started to get integrated with otherbusiness-related systems.Stage 4–Web-based technologyThe focus has shifted to automating as many transactions as possible to achieve effectiveness andefficiencies. Web-based applications use a web browser as a user interface. Users can access theapplications from any computer connected to the internet via a secure, password-protected login page.HR still continues to be the owner and custodian of HR information but others have begun to recognizethe value of this information to the business.21\f71)What is an HRIS? Describe some of its subsystems and key functions.Answer:A Human Resources Information System (HRIS) is an integrated system used to gather, store and analyzeinformation regarding an organization's human resources. There are several components, calledsubsystems that make up an HRIS. They areemployee administration, recruitment,time andattendance,training and development, pension administration, employment equity, performanceevaluation,compensation and benefits administration, organizational management, health and safety,labour relations and payroll. The highlighted subsystems will be discussed.Employee administration–You would find information such as name, hire date, address, telephone, email address, birth date, sex, position titles, and employment status.Time and attendance–Included is information necessary to calculate vacation time, such as hire date andany leaves of absences.Training and development–Includes data on an employee's skills and competencies, training coursestaken, costs of courses, developmental activities and career-planning activities.Compensation and benefits administration–Information regarding the company's compensation andbenefits plans and the policies regarding these plans.72)Describe how the role of HR has evolved in an IT-enabled organization.Answer:The impact of technology has fundamentally changed the role of HR in the organization. It has enabledHR to decrease its involvement in transactional activities, increase its focus on the customer and increaseits delivery of strategic services.Self-services such as ESS and MSS have reduced the administrative burden on HR, since the users canhave direct access to HR-related information. HRIS subsystems have reduced the amount of paperworkand coordination that was previously required of HR. Therefore, HR has more time to spend workingwith its customers (i.e. internal staff, management and other departments) in understanding their needsand providing appropriate solutions. This has also allowed HR to work with senior managementdeveloping and implementing organizational strategy.73)Identify and describe five key technology trends.Answer:1.Enhanced focus on workforce analytics–This focus will require HR to evolve as a 'decision science',providing managers with value-added decision making tools2.Increased use of portals and intranets and a greater focus on the use of virtual tools–HR will berequired to ensure that the organization is aware of the advantages of these tools and providing trainingand education to ease the transition.3.Greater access to technology–This will require HR to ensure that the appropriate security measuresare in place and to be highly diligent in terms of the types of access and who gets access.4.Continued optimization of current systems–Requires HR to be \"technologically educated.\"5.Increased focus on reducing costs–HR will be required to optimize the functionality of HR technology.Other key trends mentioned in the textbook includeincreased use of standards for data exchange andprocesses,contingency planning, andheightened awareness of HR data privacy.22\f74)What are the key challenges faced by an organization during the selection and implementation phase of anHRIS?Answer:The first challenge for the organization would be to determine (1) how much customization it requiresand (2) what type of system the organization prefers and needs. Based on this, a company can decide topurchase a system that brings in \"best practices,\" or to customize the software to fit the existing processes.The organization on the other hand may want a stand-alone system or an enterprise-wide system.Factors such as company size, projected growth, industry, existing technology, and pricing would becritical areas for consideration. For example, a small company may not require a comprehensive HRIS. Itwould be too costly to maintain such a system and therefore would not be cost effective. Also, if theexisting technology of the company does not support a large system, it may be wise to consider a basicpackage with the option of adding components as the company grows and as the technology becomesmore advanced.In the implementation stage the challenge would be to select a suitable project team to move the projectforward. The project team needs to have a balanced composition in terms of representation from withinthe company, HR, and outside consultants. It also requires running the system in a controlledenvironment before the actual launch. Existing data needs to be converted into the new system and anyglitches should be identified as much as possible during the testing period.75)What are the five key competencies for HR as outlined by the Ulrich model?Answer:The five key competencies are:1. Mastery of HR technology.2. Strategic contribution.3. Business knowledge.4. Personal credibility.5. HR delivery.76)What are the advantages and disadvantages of web-based self-service applications?Answer:Web-based self-service applications include employee self-service systems and managementself-service systems.Employee self-service systems allow employees to update their personal information, such as address,phone number, emergency contact, etc. It also enables employees to view their individual payrollinformation, enroll for benefits programs, and access HR policies and company communications materialsuch as newsletters. Therefore employees no longer need to speak to HR for routine updates.Management self-service allows managers to access a range of information not only about themselvesbut also about the employees who report to them.These systems have helped the HR to reduce operational costs because basic administrative andtransactional activities have been shifted to employees. This has enabled HR to focus more on strategicissues. Because it is an automated service, service levels are enhanced, which has led to increasedemployee satisfaction.Employees and managers can tend to view this new technology as the \"work of HR\" and therefore resistthe usage of it. The usefulness of such technology also depends on whether the content is consideredbeneficial and relevant to those who are using it. In addition, factors such as how technology-savvy theusers are, user friendliness of the systems and its culture fit within the organization contribute to thesuccessful implementation and usage of the system.23\f"},"09dF":function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.40f483d.woff"},"2SVd":function(e,t,n){"use strict";e.exports=function(e){return/^([a-z][a-z\d\+\-\.]*:)?\/\//i.test(e)}},"4ftG":function(e,t,n){var i=n("rSCU"),r=n("GMxU").f,o={}.toString,a="object"==typeof window&&window&&Object.getOwnPropertyNames?Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window):[];e.exports.f=function(e){return a&&"[object Window]"==o.call(e)?function(e){try{return r(e)}catch(e){return a.slice()}}(e):r(i(e))}},"4qcv":function(e,t,n){var i=n("isWO");"string"==typeof i&&(i=[[e.i,i,""]]),i.locals&&(e.exports=i.locals);(0,n("SZ7m").default)("760c2712",i,!0,{})},"4siE":function(e,t,n){var i={"./c1.txt":"C3gk","./c10.txt":"/AGj","./c11.txt":"jBwt","./c12.txt":"9JKs","./c13.txt":"S3bE","./c14.txt":"lULi","./c15.txt":"K2UD","./c16.txt":"Kjw2","./c17.txt":"Z0KU","./c2.txt":"iCqT","./c3.txt":"0/sY","./c4.txt":"rPnI","./c5.txt":"pdDP","./c6.txt":"OJYf","./c7.txt":"e2ab","./c8.txt":"kAwD","./c9.txt":"bKlx"};function r(e){var t=o(e);return n(t)}function o(e){if(!n.o(i,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return i[e]}r.keys=function(){return Object.keys(i)},r.resolve=o,e.exports=r,r.id="4siE"},"5A8u":function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.32562ea.woff2"},"5oMp":function(e,t,n){"use strict";e.exports=function(e,t){return t?e.replace(/\/+$/,"")+"/"+t.replace(/^\/+/,""):e}},"61rj":function(e,t){e.exports=function(e){try{return!!e()}catch(e){return!0}}},"6CFf":function(e,t,n){var i=n("L97z");e.exports=function(e,t,n){if(i(e),void 0===t)return e;switch(n){case 1:return function(n){return e.call(t,n)};case 2:return function(n,i){return e.call(t,n,i)};case 3:return function(n,i,r){return e.call(t,n,i,r)}}return function(){return e.apply(t,arguments)}}},"6Joi":function(e,t,n){"use strict";(function(e){Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var i,r,o=(i=n("wj3C"))&&"object"==typeof i&&"default"in i?i.default:i,a=n("q/0M"),s=n("mrSG"),c=n("x7I3"),l=n("zVF4"),u=o.SDK_VERSION,h=new a.Logger("@firebase/firestore");function p(){return h.logLevel===a.LogLevel.DEBUG?r.DEBUG:h.logLevel===a.LogLevel.SILENT?r.SILENT:r.ERROR}function d(e){switch(e){case r.DEBUG:h.logLevel=a.LogLevel.DEBUG;break;case r.ERROR:h.logLevel=a.LogLevel.ERROR;break;case r.SILENT:h.logLevel=a.LogLevel.SILENT;break;default:h.error("Firestore ("+u+"): Invalid value passed to `setLogLevel`")}}function f(e,t){for(var n=[],i=2;i<arguments.length;i++)n[i-2]=arguments[i];if(h.logLevel<=a.LogLevel.DEBUG){var r=n.map(g);h.debug.apply(h,["Firestore ("+u+") ["+e+"]: "+t].concat(r))}}function m(e){for(var t=[],n=1;n<arguments.length;n++)t[n-1]=arguments[n];if(h.logLevel<=a.LogLevel.ERROR){var i=t.map(g);h.error.apply(h,["Firestore ("+u+"): "+e].concat(i))}}function g(e){if("string"==typeof e)return e;var t=b.getPlatform();try{return t.formatJSON(e)}catch(t){return e}}

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.72)Describe the role of ethics in HRM and its challenges and benefits.Answer:The professionalization of HRM has created the need for a uniform code of ethics as one of therequirements of maintaining professional status. CCHRA Code of Ethics provide guidelines foremployees and employers. Increasingly HR is involved in providing ethics training, and monitoring toensure compliance with the code of ethics. Key ethical issues facing Canadian organizations pertain tosecurity of information, employee and client privacy, environmental issues, governance, and conflicts ofinterest.Main reasons for failure to achieve desired outcomes are attributed to lack of leadership and inadequatetraining. Advantages of having an ethics program properly implemented include increased confidenceamong stakeholders, greater client, customer and employee loyalty, decreased vulnerability to crime,reduced losses due to internal theft and increased public trust.73)Describe key HRM issues related to demographic trends and workforce diversity.Answer:Key demographic and diversity issues faced by Canadian organizations include age, education, women,visible minorities, aboriginal people and persons with disabilities.With the baby boomers retiring within the next few decades, Canada is said to be faced with a loomingshortage of skilled workers. On the other hand is the Sandwich Generation, with responsibilities forbringing up children as well as caring for elderly relatives who are no longer capable of functioningindependently. Therefore, organizations are forced to look at HR practices to accommodate the growingneeds and concerns of these employees. For example, some companies have started to provide eldercarebenefits to those who have elderly relatives. Members of Generation X have pushed HR practices toinclude flexible work arrangements and a better work/life balance. Generation Y, who are now beginningto enter the workforce, are known as masters of technology and comfortable with authority and diversity.Organizations are yet again required to make changes to keep this group challenged and to manage theoverall diversity in the workplace. With the level of education increasing amongst the Canadianworkforce, managers are expected to try to ensure that the talents and capabilities of employees are fullyutilized and that opportunities are provided for career growth.Employment for women has steadily increased over the decades, and organizations are accommodatingworking women and shared parenting responsibilities by offering on-site daycare, emergency childcaresupport, and flexible work arrangements. Visible minorities are entering the labour market at a fasterplace than the rest of the population, which poses numerous challenges for employers with increaseddiversity. Employers are required to recognize foreign credentials and be fair in the recruitment andselection process to give opportunities to those who are new to Canada. Persons with disabilities stillcontinue to experience high rates of unemployment and underemployment, and to receive lower pay.21\f74)Discuss how the impact of HRM on an organization is measured.Answer:HR professionals need to be able to measure the value and impact of their organization's human capitaland HRM practices. Traditional operational measures focused on the size and cost of the HR functionsuch as absenteeism rates and cost per hire, but today's measures need to reflect the quality of people andthe effectiveness of HRM initiatives that build workforce capability.Watson Wayatt developed a Human Capital Index which outlines 30 key HR practices and indicates theircontributions to shareholder value. These 30 practices were summarized into 5 categories–recruitingexcellence, clear rewards and accountability, collegial and flexible workplace, communications integrityand prudent use of resources. Many organizations are using the balanced scorecard approach, whichtranslates into financial results, customers, internal business process and human capital.75)Discuss the responsibilities of Human Resource Management.Answer:Human resources management responsibilities and activities fall into two categories: operationalresponsibilities and strategic responsibilities. Traditionally HR professionals have focused on operationalresponsibilities. However, there is a growing focus on HR taking a more strategic role.Operational responsibilities include activities such as selection and assimilation into the organization,development of capabilities and transition out of the organization. Traditional roles of HR professionalsinclude acting as an in-house consultant, offering advice on HR-related matters, formulating HR policiesand procedures and other HR services. In the recent years most of the administrative/operationalactivities of HR have been outsourced.Strategic responsibilities include getting involved in strategy formulation and execution. HRprofessionals together with line managers undertake environmental scanning, which helps theorganization to identify and analyze internal strengths and weaknesses and external threats andopportunities. HR professionals can provide information about such things as the incentive programsused by competitors, pending legislative changes and impending labour shortages. In terms of executingstrategy, HR professionals act as change agents when organizations go through significant changes suchas mergers, acquisitions, and downsizing. HR also is involved in reducing labour costs by introducingstrategies to reduce turnover, absenteeism and occupational injuries and accidents.76)You have been hired as the Director of Human Resources at a telecommunications company. Defineorganizational culture and climate and explain the importance of each to the company.Answer:Organization culture consists of the core values, beliefs, and assumptions that are widely shared bymembers of an organization. It serves a variety of purposes:· communicating what the organization \"believes in\" and \"stands for\"· providing employees with a sense of direction and expected behaviour (norms)· shaping employees' attitudes about themselves, the organization, and their roles· creating a sense of identity, orderliness, and consistency· fostering employee loyalty and commitmentOrganizational climate refers to the prevailing atmosphere that exists in an organization and its impacton employees. The major factors influencing the climate are management's leadership style, HR policiesand practices, and amount and style of communication. The type of climate that exists is generallyreflected in the level of employee motivation, job satisfaction, performance, and productivity, and thushas a direct impact on organizational profits and/or ongoing viability.22\f77)Discuss the theories that have contributed to the evolution of HRM and the challenges faced.Answer:The evolution of HRM can be discussed through the following theories.Scientific Management: Concern for ProductionThe process of \"scientifically\" analyzing manufacturing processes, reducing production costs, andcompensating employees based on their performance levels.Human Relations Movement: Concern for PeopleA management philosophy based on the belief that the attitudes and feelings of workers are importantand deserve more attention.The Human Resources Movement: Concern for People and ProductivityA management philosophy focusing on concern for people and productivity.Arriving at this joint focus on people and productivity involved four evolutionary phases.The main reason for this evolution has been economic factors such as globalization, intense competitionand deregulation, which have made human capital more important. Many traditional sources ofcompetitive advantage have become less powerful. Companies are now using human capital to create acompetitive advantage. However, there are number of challenges that slow the progress. HR is stillconsidered a cost-centre by most line and senior management. Many HR professionals also need toacquire more broad-based business knowledge and skill sets and be recognized as equal businesspartners at the decision-making table.23\f\n"},CNRE:function(e,t,n){"use

In a large firm with a number of bargaining units, humanresources and labour relations may form two divisions within a broader department, often calledindustrial relations or labour relations.Management Decision Making–Union leaders are typically involved in decisions pertaining to anyissues that will affect bargaining unit members, such as subcontracting of work, productivity standards,and job content. While management continues to claim exclusive rights over certain matters, unionleaders may challenge these rights.Centralization of Record Keeping and Standardization of Decision Making–Unionization generallyresults in greater centralization of employee record keeping and standardization of decision making toensure equity, consistency, and uniformity. More centralized coordination is typically required in theenforcement of HR policies and procedures, for example, which creates an expanded role for members ofthe LR department, as does the increased need for documentation to support decisions.Supervisory Authority and Responsibility–The major impact of unionization is at the first-line level,since it is the supervisors who are responsible for day-to-day contract administration. Greaterstandardization of decision making and centralization of record keeping may lead supervisors to feelthey have lost some of their authority, which can cause resentment, especially since they inevitably findthat unionization results in an increase in their responsibilities.Supervisors are often required to produce more written records than ever before, since documentation iscritical at grievance and arbitration hearings. They must ensure that all of their decisions and actions arein accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. Even decisions that abide by the agreement maybe challenged by the union.25\f90)Describe the current challenges to the Canadian labour movement and explain how unions are dealing withthem.Answer:Global Competition–Increased global competition and massive importation of consumer electronics,cars, clothing, textiles, and shoes has led to job losses for Canadian union members. Canadian unionswere highly opposed to NAFTA, claiming Canadian jobs would be lost to low-wage Mexican workers,as well as to the anti-union environment that exists in many U.S. states. Some unions have taken moredirect action. The United Electrical Workers, for example, subsidized organizers at Mexican plants of theU.S.-owned General Electric company.Technological Change–Technological advances have decreased the effectiveness of strikes in somesectors, because highly automated organizations can remain fully operational with minimal staffinglevels during work stoppages. Even more significant is the fact that improvements in computertechnology have lowered the demand for many blue-collar workers, and resulted in a decline in unionmembership in the auto, steel, and other manufacturing industries. E-commerce work (such asprocessing credit card claims) is highly portable, and can be shifted, almost literally, at the touch of abutton from one centre to another–even overseas. To deal with such threats, some unions have negotiatedcollective agreement protection for workers whose skills are threatened by technological obsolescence.Privatization and the Unionization of White-collar Employees, Managers, and Professionals –In thepast, many white-collar employees tended to identify more with owners or managers than with theirblue-collar colleagues, often enjoying certain privileges and status symbols available to salariedemployees only. Because the improvements in pay, benefits, and working conditions that werenegotiated by the union representing their blue-collar coworkers were often extended to them as amatter of course, there was little perceived need to unionize. In recent years, however, the growth in thesize of many public- and private-sector organizations has tended to distance them from management,which has made unionization more attractive. Increasing difficulties in attempting to resolve grievances,combined with a lack of job security related to downsizing in all sectors, as well as the privatization ofservices ranging from hydro to home care, has also led to increased interest in unionization amongwhite-collar workers.In response to the threats to job security posed by downsizing, privatization, and public-privatepartnerships, and the decrease in membership numbers associated with the decline in blue-collar jobs,unions started to increase their efforts to organize white-collar employees. Service-orientedorganizations, such as insurance agencies, banks, retail stores, fast-food chains, and governmentagencies, have been targeted for organizing campaigns. Even small businesses are being organized. Toattract white-collar employees, unions have changed their focus and bargaining priorities. In addition tofocussing more on equity and family issues, unions are also capitalizing on the health and safety risksassociated with white-collar jobs, such as the effects of working at video display terminals for longperiods of time, and the potential for repetitive strain injury associated with the jobs of clerical workersand cashiers.Another group that has been targeted for unionization includes managers and professionals. Ofparticular appeal to these employees is the unions' desire to protect the job security of those represented,something that has been seriously threatened due to extensive downsizing in both public- andprivate-sector organizations.Innovative Workplace Practices–In workplaces in which employees participate in decision making, havea high degree of autonomy and little supervision, and are paid based on their performance or theknowledge/skills they have attained, there may be less perceived need for a union. Some individualsargue that such innovative workplace practices as semi-autonomous work teams, skill-based pay, profitsharing and employee stock ownership plans undermine union power by coopting employees andaligning employee interests with those of management. On the other hand, in workplaces in which theunions have supported such changes, the end result may be better communication and more cooperation,a win-win situation.26\f91)Amin is the new VP of Labour Relations at a telecomminications company which has a history of poorlabour-management relations. Describe the strategies you recommend he use to assist in building an effectiveand more positive labour-management relationship.Answer:Instituting an open-door policy–When the key managers involved in labour-management relationswelcome employees into their office a to discuss any problems or concerns, and employees feelcomfortable in doing so, many issues: can be resolved informally. For example, if the president of thelocal knows that he or she can approach the LR manager \"off the record\" and that anything discussed insuch sessions will be kept strictly confidential, fewer grievances and a more trusting and harmoniousrelationship often result.Extending the courtesy of prior consultation–While every management decision does not require unionapproval, if any actions that might affect union members are discussed with the union executive first, thelikelihood of grievances is greatly reduced.Demonstrating genuine concern for employee well-being–When managers are genuinely concernedabout employee well-being, and demonstrate that concern, mutual trust and respect are oftenestablished. This involves fair treatment and communication going well above and beyond therequirements of the collective agreement.Forming joint study committees–Forming labour/management committees to investigate and resolvecomplex issues can lead to innovative and creative solutions, as well as a better relationship.Holding joint training programs–When a contract is first signed, it can be beneficial to hold a jointtraining program to ensure that supervisors and union stewards are familiar with the terms andconditions specified therein and understand the intent of the negotiating teams. Such training can reducemisunderstandings and the likelihood of disagreement regarding interpretation of contract language.Joint training programs can also be extremely helpful in building the cooperation necessary to deal moreeffectively with other employment-related issues of concern to both parties, such as employee health andsafety.Meeting regularly–Whether required by the collective agreement or voluntarily instituted, regularlyscheduled union-management meetings can result in more effective communication and the resolutionof problems/concerns before they become formal grievance issues.Using third-party assistance–To build a better relationship, it is often beneficial to bring in a consultantor a government agency representative to help identify common goals and objectives and ways in whichtrust and communication can be strengthened.92)Differentiate between interest arbitration and rights arbitration and explain the use of each.Answer:Interest arbitration involves the use of an outside third party to impose the terms of a collectiveagreement. The right to interest arbitration is conferred by law on those who are not permitted to strike,as is the case with hospital and nursing home employees, police officers and firefighters in mostjurisdictions, and public servants in some. Interest arbitration is also involved when special legislation ispassed, ordering striking or locked-out parties back to work, due to public hardship.Rights arbitration resolves a disagreement between an organization and the union representing itsemployees with regard to the interpretation or application of one or more clauses in the collectiveagreement.93)Differentiate between business and social unionism.Answer:Business unionism refers to the activities of labour unions focusing on economic and welfare issues,including pay and benefits, job security, and working conditions. Included in business unionism isnegotiating for greater job security, improved economic conditions, and better working conditions.Social unionism refers to the activities of unions directed at furthering the interests of their members byinfluencing the social and economic policies of governments at all levels. The objectives of socialunionism are often accomplished by lobbying and speaking out on proposed legislative reforms, such asthe introduction of employment equity legislation or amendments to LR acts.27\f"},KxBS:function(e,t,n){var i=n("I1rR");i(i.P,"String",{repeat:n("gRXz")})},L97z:function(e,t){e.exports=function(e){if("function"!=typeof e)throw TypeError(e+" is not a function!");return e}},LYNF:function(e,t,n){"use strict";var i=n("OH9c");e.exports=function(e,t,n,r,o){var a=new Error(e);return i(a,t,n,r,o)}},LmZi:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,"registerStorage",function(){return $e});var i=n("wj3C"),r=n.n(i),o="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com",a="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com",s="/v0",c="/v0",l=12e4,u=6e4,h=-9007199254740991,p=function(){function e(e,t){this.code_=f(e),this.message_="Firebase Storage: "+t,this.serverResponse_=null,this.name_="FirebaseError"}return e.prototype.codeProp=function(){return this.code},e.prototype.codeEquals=function(e){return f(e)===this.codeProp()},e.prototype.serverResponseProp=function(){return this.serverResponse_},e.prototype.setServerResponseProp=function(e){this.serverResponse_=e},Object.defineProperty(e.prototype,"name",{get:function(){return this.name_},enumerable:!0,configurable:!0}),Object.defineProperty(e.prototype,"code",{get:function(){return this.code_},enumerable:!0,configurable:!0}),Object.defineProperty(e.prototype,"message",{get:function(){return this.message_},enumerable:!0,configurable:!0}),Object.defineProperty(e.prototype,"serverResponse",{get:function(){return this.serverResponse_},enumerable:!0,configurable:!0}),e}(),d={UNKNOWN:"unknown",OBJECT_NOT_FOUND:"object-not-found",BUCKET_NOT_FOUND:"bucket-not-found",PROJECT_NOT_FOUND:"project-not-found",QUOTA_EXCEEDED:"quota-exceeded",UNAUTHENTICATED:"unauthenticated",UNAUTHORIZED:"unauthorized",RETRY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:"retry-limit-exceeded",INVALID_CHECKSUM:"invalid-checksum",CANCELED:"canceled",INVALID_EVENT_NAME:"invalid-event-name",INVALID_URL:"invalid-url",INVALID_DEFAULT_BUCKET:"invalid-default-bucket",NO_DEFAULT_BUCKET:"no-default-bucket",CANNOT_SLICE_BLOB:"cannot-slice-blob",SERVER_FILE_WRONG_SIZE:"server-file-wrong-size",NO_DOWNLOAD_URL:"no-download-url",INVALID_ARGUMENT:"invalid-argument",INVALID_ARGUMENT_COUNT:"invalid-argument-count",APP_DELETED:"app-deleted",INVALID_ROOT_OPERATION:"invalid-root-operation",INVALID_FORMAT:"invalid-format",INTERNAL_ERROR:"internal-error"};function f(e){return"storage/"+e}function m(){return new p(d.UNKNOWN,"An unknown error occurred, please check the error payload for server response.")}function g(){return new p(d.CANCELED,"User canceled the upload/download.")}function y(){return new p(d.CANNOT_SLICE_BLOB,"Cannot slice blob for upload.

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.97)What are the advantages and disadvantages of filling open positions with internal candidates?Answer:There are at least fiveadvantages of recruiting within the organization:· Employees see that competence is rewarded, thus enhancing commitment, morale and performance.· Having already been with the firm for some time, inside candidates may be more committed tocompany goals and less likely to leave.· Managers are provided with a longer-term perspective when making business decisions.· It is generally safer to promote employees from within, since the firm is likely to have a more accurateassessment of the person's skills and performance level than would otherwise be the case.· Inside candidates require less orientation than outsiders.Hiring from within also has a number ofdisadvantages:· Employees who apply for jobs and don't get them may become discontented.· Managers may be required to post all job openings and interview all inside candidates, even when theyalready know whom they wish to hire, thus wasting considerable time and creating false hope on thepart of those employees not genuinely being considered.· Employees may be less satisfied with and accepting of a new boss appointed from within their ownranks than they would a newcomer.· It is sometimes difficult for a newly-chosen leader to adjust to no longer being \"one of the gang.\"· There is a possibility of \"inbreeding.\" When an entire management team has been brought up throughthe ranks, there may be a tendency to make decisions by the book and to maintain the status quo, when anew and innovative direction is needed.98)Recruiting a diverse workforce is a necessity. Compare and contrast the benefits of attracting older workersversus younger employees.Answer:Benefits of recruiting older workers: high job satisfaction; a strong sense of loyalty and organizationalcommitment; a strong work ethic; good people skills; and willingness to work in a variety of roles,including part-timeBenefits of recruiting younger workers: they bring energy, enthusiasm, and physical strength to theirpositions99)List and explain the steps an employer should take to brand itself as an \"employer of choice.\"Answer:There are 3 steps in employer branding.The employer should first define the target audience, where to find them, and what they want from anemployer.The second step is to develop the employee value proposition. In this step the employer should identifythe specific reasons that make the organization a unique place to work and a more attractive employerfor the target audience.The third step is to communicate the brand by incorporating the value proposition in to all recruitmentefforts.26\f100)Describe the steps in the recruitment process.Answer:Job openings are identified through HR planning or manager request. HR plans play a vital role in theidentification process, because they indicate present and future openings and specify which should befilled internally and which externally. When openings arise unexpectedly, the immediate supervisor mayhave to complete a human resources requisition form or a business plan to obtain authorization toproceed with recruitment and selection.The job requirements are determined. This involves reviewing the job description and the jobspecification and updating them, if necessary. Manager comments may also prove helpful in identifyingrequirements, particularly pertaining to personality and fit.Appropriate recruiting source(s) and method(s) are chosen. There is no single best recruiting technique,and the most appropriate for any given position depend(s) on a number of factors, including type ofposition, recruitment budget, and compensation policies.A pool of qualified recruits is generated.101)What are the advantages of external recruitment?Answer:External recruitment may result in:· generation of a larger pool of qualified candidates, which may have a positive impact on the quality ofthe selection decision· availability of a more diverse pool of applicants, which can assist in meeting employment equity goalsand timetables· acquisition of skills or knowledge not currently available within the organization and/or new ideas andcreative problem-solving techniques· elimination of rivalry and competition caused by employees jockeying for transfers and promotions,which can hinder interpersonal and interdepartmental cooperation· potential cost savings resulting from hiring individuals who already have the skills, rather thanproviding extensive training.102)Even when detailed resumes have been submitted, most firms also request that a standardized companyapplication form be completed by every job applicant. Why?Answer:· Candidate comparison is facilitated because information is collected in a uniform manner.· The information that the company requires is requested; it is not simply left to the candidate to includethat which he or she wishes to reveal. By asking for work history in reverse chronological order andinsisting that dates be provided, for example, gaps in work history may be revealed that are concealed onthe candidate's resume.· Candidates are typically asked to complete an application form while on the company premises, whichmeans that the application form is more likely to be a sample of the candidate's own work.· Application forms typically ask the candidate to provide written authorization for reference checking. Aphotocopy of this section of the application form can be faxed or mailed to individuals being asked forreferences, if so requested.Candidates are asked to acknowledge that the information provided is true and accurate, which protectsthe company from applicants who falsify their credentials.· Many application forms today have an optional section regarding designated group member status.This information is used for employment equity tracking purposes.27\f103)You are a human resources Consultant hired by a client to advise on developing a career Web site. What are thebest practices of career website development that you would discuss with the client?Answer:· Include candid information about the culture, career paths, and business prospects. Some onlineapplicants also want to view virtual tours of the workplace.· Design separate sections for different types of job seekers, such as students.· Have a direct link from the home page to the career page.· Have a job search tool that allows applicants to search open job position by location and job category.· Have a standardized application or resume builder to allow for easy applicant screening.· Utilize \"e-mail to a friend\" options for visitor referrals.104)A well established advertising firm wishes to employ more younger workers in order to bring new perspectivesand creativity to the firm.

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.85)Discuss the differences between a defined benefit and a defined contribution pension plan.Answer:A defined benefit pension plan contains a formula for determining retirement benefits. It is mostbeneficial for long-term service employees. Employers must provide the final pension notwithstandingthe pension's health. The actual benefits to be received are defined ahead of time. A defined contributionpension plan specifies what contribution the employer will make to a retirement fund set up for theemployee.

In a defined benefit pension plan, theemployee knows ahead of time what his or her retirement benefits will be on retirement. With a definedcontribution plan, the employee cannot be sure of his or her retirement benefits until retirement, when hisor her share of the money in the fund is used to buy an annuity.86)Explain what an EAP offers employees.Answer:An EAP (Employee Assistance Plan) is a formal employer program that provides employees withconfidential counseling and/or treatment programs for problems such as mental health issues,marital/family problems, work/life balance issues, stress, legal problems, substance abuse etc.87)Explain three strategies for reducing health-benefit costs.Answer:increase the amount of health-care costs paid by employees; restrict the drugs covered to those on apublished list; health promotion.88)Briefly describe the four major government-sponsored employee benefits in Canada.Answer:Employment Insurance (EI): provides income benefits if a person is unable to work through no fault ofhis or her own.Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP): programs that provide three types of benefits– retirementincome, survivor/death benefits, and disability benefits.

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.96)Differentiate between structured, semi-structured/mixed, and unstructured interviews.Answer:An unstructured interview is an unstructured, conversational-style interview, where the interviewerpursues points of interest as they come up in response to questions. A structured interview is aninterview following a set sequence of questions. A mixed, or semi-structured, interview is an interviewformat that combines the structured and unstructured techniques.97)Discuss the legal implications associated with ineffective or incompetent selection.Answer:Human rights legislation in every Canadian jurisdiction prohibits discrimination in all aspects and termsand conditions of employment on such grounds as race, religion or creed, colour, marital status, gender,age, and disability. Firms must ensure that all of their selection procedures are free of both intentionaland systemic discrimination. Failure to do so may result in human rights complaints.Those organizations required by law to implement anemployment equity plan must ensure that all oftheir employment systems, including selection, are bias-free and do not have an adverse impact onmembers of four designated groups: women, visible minorities, Aboriginal Peoples, and persons withdisabilities.Another legal implication is employerliability for negligent or wrongful hiring. Courts are increasinglyfinding employers liable when employees with unsuitable backgrounds are hired and subsequentlyengage in criminal activities falling within the scope of their employment.98)Selection tools must be both reliable and valid. Explain these terms.Answer:Reliability refers to the degree to which interviews, tests, and other selection procedures yieldcomparable data over a period of time; in other words, the degree of dependability, consistency, orstability of the measures used.Validity refers to the accuracy with which a predictor measures what it is supposed to measure. In thecontext of selection, validity is an indicator of the extent to which data from a selection technique, such asa test or interview, are related to or predictive of subsequent performance on the job.99)List and discuss five common interviewing mistakes:Answer:Poor planning- conducted without planning and without prepared written questions in advance.Snap judgments- jump to conclusions during the first few minutes of the interview or before it begins,based on candidate's test scores or resume.Negative emphasis- interviewers may be more influenced by unfavourable than favourable informationPoor knowledge of job- interviewers may not know what the job entails, and what type of candidate isbest suited for jobContrast error- order in which applicants are seen can affect how they are rated27\f100)You are the Director of Human Resources in an accounting firm and are preparing to advise the hiring managerin interviewing candidates for articling positions with the firm. You've already identified key selection criteriafor the position, which include: excellent analytical skills, ability to work under pressure and the ability tointeract well with clients and coworkers. Generateonesituational interview questionandone behaviouralinterview question for the positions. Be sure to explain how each of the questions is relevant to any of theselection criteria identified.Answer:Situational interview question:· The question must ask a hypothetical situation. It should also ask one or more of the competencies listed(i.e., have analytical skills, work under pressure, interact well).· Example: \"Assume you got a call from one of your clients at 1 a.m. Sunday. The client said he hadsomething he needed to discuss immediately. You were in bed when you received the call. How wouldyou handle the client's request? The question should set up a specific hypothetical situation.· For the relevance of the question, the there must be justification that the question examines one or moreof the competencies. (In the case of the example, the question tests knowledge of best practices inhandling client interactions and, to a certain extent, ability to work under pressure.)Behavioural interview question:· The question must ask about the candidate's past experience.· Example: \"Tell me about a time when you had a dispute or disagreement with a coworker. How did youresolve the issue?\"· For the relevance of the question, the there must be justification that the question examines one or moreof the competencies. (In the case of the example, the question tests ability to interact well with coworkersand resolve differences.101)Describe the legal issues involved in obtaining and providing reference information.Answer:Failure to check references can lead tonegligent or wrongful hiring suits that may involve significantdamages. In providing reference information, the concept ofqualified privilegeis important.Generallyspeaking, if comments are made in confidence for a public purpose, without malice, and are honestlybelieved, the defence of \"qualified privilege\" exists. Thus, if honest, fair and candid references are given,then this doctrine generally protects the reference giver, even if negative information is imparted aboutthe candidate. Nevertheless, with the fear of civil litigation increasing, more Canadian companies areadopting a \"no reference\" policy regarding previous employees or are only willing to confirm theposition held and dates of employment especially in the case of discharged employees.28\f"},eKN1:function(e,t,n){t.f=n("jZgK")},endd:function(e,t,n){"use strict";function

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.77)Explain an employer's duty to provide \"reasonable accommodation.\" Give an example of reasonableaccommodation.Answer:Reasonable accommodation deals with the adjustment of employment policies and practices so that noindividual is denied benefits, disadvantaged in employment, or prevented from carrying out the essentialcomponents of a job on the basis of prohibited grounds of discrimination. This may involve makingadjustments to meet needs based on the group to which an individual belongs, such as scheduleadjustments to accommodate religious beliefs, or on an individual employee basis, such as work stationredesign to enable an individual with a physical disability to perform a particular task.Employers are expected to accommodate to the point of undue hardship, a term for which there is nodefinitive definition. Generally, however, to claim undue hardship, employers must present evidencethat the financial cost of accommodation (even with outside sources of funding) or health and safety risksto the individual concerned or other employees would make accommodation impossible. Factors thatcannot be taken into consideration include business inconvenience, customer preference, or disruption toa collective agreement.Refusing to make every reasonable effort to accommodate employees is a violation of human rightslegislation.An example of reasonable accommodation would be installing an elevator in a government building toaccommodate persons in wheelchairs.23\f78)Discuss sexual harassment and its impact on employees and the work environment. Provide examples of sexualcoercion and sexual annoyance.Answer:Sexual harassment is defined as offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex aswell as behaviour of a sexual nature that creates an intimidating, unwelcome, hostile or offensive workenvironment. Sexual harassment can be divided into two categories:sexual coercion, which isharassment of a sexual nature that results in some direct consequence to the worker's employment statusor some gain in or loss of tangible job benefits, andsexual annoyance, which is sexually related conductthat is hostile, intimidating or offensive to the employee but has no direct link to tangible job benefits orloss thereof.All types of sexual harassment can have negative impact on employees as well as the work environment.Employees will feel uncomfortable seeing such work conditions, and employee morale and productivitycan be significantly impacted. Absenteeism can increase amongst staff. They will have less and less trustin management if action is not taken. The organization can run the risk of facing legal action forcondoning such behaviours.79)Describe diversity management and what factors act as barriers to diversity management programs.Answer:Diversity management involves a set of activities designed to integrate all members of an organization'smulticultural work force and use their diversity to enhance the firm's effectiveness.Canada has seen continued immigration from many lands during the last four decades and managers aremanaging an increasingly diverse work force. Diversity in the work force can be positive if utilized andchannelled properly. As research shows, diversity can enhance organizational effectiveness and culture.However, there are number of barriers that should be handled appropriately in order to reap themaximum out of diversity initiatives. It is recommended that diversity initiatives be taken slowly, sincethey involve complex change processes. There may be resistance from the existing workforce which willhave to be overcome. Stereotyped beliefs and prejudices can surface, creating resentment.Therefore it is important for any organization that is undertaking diversity initiatives to have topmanagement commitment, training, inclusive representation and communication, support andmentoring programs/groups, regular audits and defined management responsibilities andaccountabilities.80)What steps should an employer use to design an employment equity program and ensure success?Answer:Employment equity programs are designed to achieve a balanced representation of designated groupmembers in the organization. It is a major management exercise because existing employees must becomfortable with other from diverse backgrounds, cultures, religions, etc. The following are the key stepsto follow when designing a program:1. Obtaining senior management commitment and support–a written policy endorsed by seniormanagement should be posted throughout the organization or distributed to all employees.2. Data collection and analysis–this permits the organization to develop an internal work force profile.3. Employment systems review–a comprehensive examination of existing policies, procedures, practices,etc., to determine their impact on designated group members, so that existing intentional and systemicbarriers can be eliminated.4. Plan development–setting of goals and timetable.5. Implementation.6. Monitoring, evaluating and revising.81)What are prohibited grounds of discrimination.Answer:Human rights legislation prohibits discrimination against all Canadians in a number of areas, includingemployment. These areas are known as prohibited grounds of discrimination. These grounds changeacross provinces and territories. However, all jurisdictions prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race,colour, religion/creed, sex, marital status, age, physical and mental disability and sexual orientation.Some but not all jurisdictions prohibit discrimination on the basis of national or ethnic origin, familystatus, ancestry or place of origin and various other grounds.24\f82)Differentiate between intentional and unintentional discrimination.Answer:Intentional discrimination involves the deliberate use of criteria such as race, religion, or otherprohibited grounds when making employment decisions. It can be direct, indirect, in the form ofdifferential treatment, or on the basis of association. Deliberate discrimination does not have to be overt(blatant).Unintentional discrimination, also known as systemic and constructive discrimination, is difficult todetect and combat. Typically, it is embedded in policies and practices that, although appearing neutral onthe surface and being implemented impartially, have adverse impact on specific groups of people forreasons that are not job related or required for the safe and efficient operation of the business.83)Discuss the four designated groups and differential treatment by employers during employment.Answer:The four designated groups are: women, visible minorities, aboriginal people and people withdisabilities. Differential treatment by employers include lower pay on average, occupational segregation,higher rates of unemployment, underemployment and concentration in low-status jobs with littlepotential for career growth.For example, women are still not represented adequately in senior management positions, though theymake up more than one-half of the Canadian workforce. Similarly, visible minorities also experiencesimilar issues in terms of occupational segregation. Many immigrants are highly educated visibleminorities. They are typically unable to obtain employment that makes full use of their knowledge, skillsand abilities, which is called underemployment. The income of people with disabilities is much lowerthan that of other Canadian workers. Aboriginals are concentrated in three occupational groups: clerical,skilled crafts and trade, and semi-skilled manual work.25\f"},ifzb:function(e,t,n){var i=n("ezrC")("keys"),r=n("U/+K");e.exports=function(e){return i[e]||(i[e]=r(e))}},"igO+":function(e,t,n){

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.95)You are the HR professional responsible for Human Resources Planning (HRP) at Dineromucha Inc., aCanadian credit union. You will be implementing the nominal group technique for forecasting human resourcesneeds. What should you be aware of regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this technique?Answer:The advantages of this technique include involvement of key decision makers, a future focus, and the factthat the group discussion can facilitate the exchange of ideas and greater acceptance of results.Disadvantages include: subjectivity and the potential for group pressure to lead to less accurateassessment than could be obtained through other ways.26\f96)What are the factors that should be considered when forecasting the number and type of people needed to meetthe organization's objectives?Answer:· the demand for the organization's product or service· projected turnover as a result of resignations or termination· quality and nature of employees in relation to what management sees as the changing needs of theorganization· decisions to upgrade the quality of products or services or enter into new markets, which might changethe required employee skill mix· planned technological and administrative changes aimed at increasing productivity and reducingemployee headcount· the financial resources available to each department.97)Explain what the Delphi Technique is, and what steps are involved in this process.Answer:· It is useful for long-range forecasting and other strategic planning issues.· It typically involves outside experts as well as company employees, based on the premise that outsidersmay be able to assess changes and their potential impact more objectively.· There are several steps involved in the process, including:1.Problem identification–each group member must submit a potential solution by completing aquestionnaire; direct face-to-face contact is not permitted2. After the questionnaire is completed independently and anonymously, theresults are compiled at acentralized location.3. A copy of theresults isgiven to each member of the team.4. If there are differences in opinion, each individual uses the feedback from other experts tofine-tunehis or her independent assessment.5. The last 2 steps are repeated as often as necessary until a consensus is reached.98)Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the Delphi Technique.Answer:The advantages include: involvement of key decision makers and future focus. The technique permits thegroup to critically evaluate a wide range of views. Disadvantages include the fact that judgments maynot use objective data efficiently, the time and costs involved, and the potential difficulty in integratingdiverse opinions.27\f99)Briefly describe the tools and techniques used to forecast the supply of internal candidates.Answer:Some firms use theMarkov analysis technique to track the pattern of employee movements throughvarious jobs and develop a transitional probability matrix for forecasting internal supply by specificcategories, such as position and gender. Such an analysis shows the actual number (and percentage) ofemployees who remain in each job from one year to the next, as well as the proportions promoted,demoted, transferred, and leaving the organization. These proportions (probabilities) are then used toforecast human resources supply.Skills inventories contain comprehensive information about the capabilities of current employees.Prepared manually or using a computerized system, data gathered for each employee include name, age,date of employment, current position, present duties and responsibilities, educational background,previous work history, skills, abilities and interests. Information about current performance andreadiness for promotion is generally included as well. Data pertaining to managerial staff are compiled inamanagement inventory. In addition to the information listed above, such inventories include thenumber and types of employees supervised, duties of such employees, total budget managed, previousmanagerial duties and responsibilities, and managerial training received.Replacement charts are a visual representation of who will replace whom in the event of a job opening.Many employers use such charts to keep track of potential internal candidates for their most importantpositions. Such charts typically indicate age and replacement status of potential internal candidates,based on two variables: present performance and promotability. Replacement charts provide an excellentquick reference tool, they contain very little information. For that reason, many firms prefer to usereplacement summaries. Such summaries list likely replacements for each position and their relativestrengths and weaknesses, as well as information about current position, performance, promotability, ageand experienceSuccession planning is the process used to ensure a suitable supply of successors for current and futuresenior or key jobs, so that the careers of individuals can be effectively planned and managed. Activitiesinvolved include: analysis of the demand for managers and professional by company level, function andskill; audit of existing executives and projection of likely future supply from internal and externalsources; planning of individual career paths; career counseling; accelerated promotions, withdevelopment targeted against the future needs of the business; performance-related training anddevelopment; planned strategic recruitment; and the actual activities by which openings are filled.100)You are the V.P. Human Resources at a major Canadian automaker which has been significantly impacted bythe recent recession. Briefly describe the major strategies available to you to deal with the labour surplus at thefirm.Answer:You could initially respond to such a situation by implementing ahiring freeze, which means thatopenings are filled by reassigning current employees, and no outsiders are hired unless authorization isgranted by the CEO due to extenuating circumstances. The surplus is slowly reduced throughattrition,which is the normal separation of employees from an organization due to resignation, retirement, ordeath. Some organizations attempt to accelerate attrition by offering incentives to employees to leave,such asbuyout andearly retirement programs.There are a number of strategies to reduce the total number of hours worked. Included arejob sharing,which involves dividing the duties of a single position between two or more employees; reducingfull-time positions topart-time work; instituting awork-sharing arrangement, whereby employeeswork three or four days a week and collect Employment Insurance on their non-work day(s); and placingemployees on areduced work week, which involves employees working fewer hours and receiving lesspay.It may be necessary for the firm to place employees onlayoff. This involves the temporary withdrawal ofemployment to workers for economic or business reasons. Layoffs may be of relatively short duration, ormay last months or even years.When employees are no longer required by the organization, the employment relationship may bepermanently severed. This is known astermination. You should consider severance pay obligations andsupplying outplacement assistance.28\f101)Differentiate between trend analysis, ratio analysis, and regression analysis.Answer:Trend analysis involves studying the firm's employment levels over a period of years to predict futureneeds. The purpose is to identify employment trends that might continue into the future. Becauseemployment levels rarely depend solely on the passage of time, but rather on factors such as changes insales volume and productivity, trend analysis can only provide an initial estimateRatio analysis involves making estimates based on the ratio between (1) some causal factor (such as salesvolume) and (2) number of employees required. Like trend analysis, ratio analysis assumes thatproductivity remains about the same. Thus, ratio analysis can only provide an approximation of futureHR needs.Regression analysis is a more sophisticated statistical technique that involves the use of a mathematicalformula to project future demands based on an established relationship between (1) an organization'semployment level (dependent variable) and (2) some measurable factor of output (independent variable)such as revenue, sales, or production level. Where there are several dependent and/or independentvariables, multiple regression analysis is used.102)You are the HR professional responsible for Human Resources Planning (HRP) at a major Canadian insuranceprovider, Bonnvue Inc. Environmental scanning is a critical component of HRP. Which environmental factorswould you monitor as part of your responsibility for HRP?Answer:· economic conditions (general and regional)· market and competitive trends· new or revised laws and decisions of courts and quasi-judicial bodies· social concerns related to health care, childcare, and educational priorities· technological changes· demographic trends.103)Explain the relationship between human resources planning and strategic planning.Answer:Strategic plans are developed and implemented by people in the organization. Determining whether ornot the skills required will be available is a critical element of the strategic planning process. Althoughproduction, financial and marketing plans have been recognized as important considerations in thestrategic planning process, HR plans are also seen today as another essential component. It is becomingclear that HRP and strategic planning become effective when a reciprocal and interdependentrelationship exists between them.104)Explain the importance of Human Resources Planning (HRP).Answer:HRP provides a framework for the coordination and integration of HRM policies and practices related tostaffing and development activities, since they affect the requirements for and supply of humanresources. Effective HRP helps a firm to:· achieve its goals and objectives· plan and coordinate recruitment, selection, training, career planning, and other staffing anddevelopment activities more effectively· achieve economies in hiring new workers· make major labour market demands more successfully· anticipate and avoid shortages and surpluses of human resources· control and/or reduce labour costs· utilize employees' capabilities more effectively, thereby increasing performance and productivity, andreducing dissatisfaction and turnover· establish employment equity goals and timetables that are realistic and attainable29\f105)You are the HR professional responsible for Human Resources Planning (HRP) at Dineromucha Inc., aCanadian credit union. You will be implementing the nominal group technique for forecasting human resourcesneeds. Cite and explain the steps you will follow.Answer:The steps are as follows:· Each member of the group independently writes down his or her ideas on the problem or issue.· Going around the table, each member then presents one idea.· This process continues until all ideas have been presented and recorded, typically on a flipchart.· No discussion is permitted during this step.· Clarification is then sought, followed by group discussion and evaluation.· Finally, each member is asked to rank the ideas.· This is done independently and in silence.30\f"},"q/0M":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,"setLogLevel",function(){return c}),n.d(t,"Logger",function(){return s}),n.d(t,"LogLevel",function(){return i});

Write your answer in the space provided or on a separate sheet of paper.76)Job analysis is called the cornerstone of HRM. Discuss.Answer:Job analysis is the procedure for determining the tasks, duties and responsibilities of each job and thehuman attributes required to perform the job. Job analysis information is used to develop job descriptionsand job specifications. In addition, it is also used for a number of interrelated HRM activities such as HRplanning, recruitment and selection, training and development, career management, compensation andperformance appraisals.For example, knowing the actual requirements of jobs is essential for planning future staffing needs. Jobdescriptions and job specifications are used to decide what sort of person to recruit and hire. Job analysisinformation is used to determine the relative value of jobs in the organization and appropriatecompensation levels. By comparing the knowledge, abilities and skills that employees bring to the jobwith those that are identified by job analysis, managers can determine the gaps that need to be addressedthrough training and development.As you can see, job analysis information is used for a variety of HRM activities and can be called thecornerstone of HRM.77)Discuss human rights legislative requirements pertaining to job descriptions and specifications.Answer:Job Descriptions: Human rights legislation requires employers to ensure that there is no discriminationon any of the prohibited grounds in any aspect or terms and conditions of employment. To ensure thatjob descriptions comply with this legislation, the following points should be kept in mind:· Job descriptions are NOT legally required, but are highly advisable.· Essential job duties should be clearly identified in the job description. Indicating the percentage of timespent on each duty and/or listing duties in order of importance are strategies used to differentiatebetween essential and nonessential tasks and responsibilities.· When assessing suitability for employment, training program enrolment, and transfers or promotions;and when appraising performance, the only criteria examined should be knowledge, skills and abilitiesrequired by the essential duties of the job.· Even when an employee cannot perform one or more of the essential duties due to reasons related to aprohibited ground, such as physical disability or religion, reasonable accommodation to the point ofundue hardship is required.Job Specifications: To comply with human rights legislation, a few key points should be kept in mind:· All listed qualifications must be justifiable, based on the current job duties and responsibilities.· Unjustifiably high educational and/or lengthy experience requirements can lead to systemicdiscrimination. For that reason, many employers are no longer indicating that a degree or diploma ismandatory; rather, they specify that the position calls for a university degree in a specific area, a collegediploma in that area, or an equivalent combination of education and work experience.· The qualifications of the current incumbent should not be confused with the minimum requirements,since he or she might be under- or overqualified.· Identifying the human requirements using a statistical approach is more legally defensible than using ajudgmental approach.22\f78)Discuss the role of industrial engineering.Answer:Industrial engineering is concerned with analyzing work methods and establishing time standards toimprove efficiency. Industrial engineers systematically identify, analyze, and time the elements of eachjob's work cycle and determine which, if any, elements can be modified, combined, rearranged, oreliminated to reduce the time needed to complete the cycle.To establish time standards, industrial engineers measure and record the time required to complete eachelement in the work cycle, using a stopwatch or work sampling techniques, and then combine these timesto determine the total. Adjustments are then made to compensate for differences in skill level, breaks, andinterruptions due to such factors as machine maintenance or breakdown. The adjusted time becomes thestandard time for that particular work cycle, which serves as an objective basis for evaluating andimproving employee performance and determining incentive pay.Since jobs are created primarily to enable an organization to achieve its objectives, industrial engineeringcannot be ignored as a disciplined and objective approach to job design. However, too much emphasis onthe concerns of industrial engineering–improving efficiency and simplifying work methods–may resultin human considerations being neglected or downplayed What may be improvements in job design andefficiency from an engineering standpoint can sometimes prove to be physiologically or psychologicallyunsound Thus, to be effective, job design must also provide for the satisfaction of human psychologicaland physiological needs.79)Discuss the changing nature of jobs. What factors are driving the change, and what are its implications for thefuture?Answer:The traditional meaning of a \"job\" as a set of well-defined responsibilities is changing. This is a result ofreduced hierarchical structure in organizations, work being done in teams, more focus on organizationalgoals rather than on rules, and continual change. The focus becomes defining the job at hand for theoverall benefit of the organization, and employees are increasingly expected to adapt to such changes. Asa result of these changes work has become more cognitively complex, more team based, more dependenton social skills and on technological skills. As a result some organizations are focusing on personalcompetencies and skills rather than on specific tasks and responsibilities. More firms are moving towardnew organizational structures built around jobs that are broad and that may change on a daily basis. Insuch situations workers no longer take their cues from job descriptions or supervisor instructions butrather from signals coming from the changing demands of the job at hand.80)Discuss types of organizational structures. What would you recommend as an organizational structure for acompany in retail business and why?Answer:Organizational structure refers to the formal relationships among jobs in an organization. There are threetypes of organizational structure: bureaucratic, flat and boundaryless. Structure of an organizationdepends on the company's strategic goals.Retail organizations typically have flat organizational structures. This is because the emphasis of a retailorganization would be on teams and customer service. Therefore, more authority and autonomy has to bepassed down to teams and line managers, which depict a decentralized management style. Since thecompetitive advantage of the company is based on the quality and speed of customer service, theorganization requires a flat structure to make faster decisions to resolve customer-centred problems. Jobare broadly defined with general job descriptions with the goals of striving for higher levels of customerservice rather than specializing in particular tasks and aspects of a job.23\f81)List and describe the steps involved in job analysis.Answer:Step One:Identify the use to which the information will be put, since this will determine the types ofdata that should be collected and the techniques used.Step Two: Review relevant background information, such as organization charts, process charts, and jobdescriptions.Step Three: Select the representative positions and jobs to be analyzed This is necessary when there aremany incumbents in a single job and when a number of similar jobs are to be analyzed, since it would betoo time consuming to analyze every position and job.Step Four: Analyze the jobs by collecting data on the job activities, required employee behaviours,working conditions, and human traits and abilities needed to perform the job.Step Five: Review the information with the worker(s) performing the job and with the immediatesupervisor. This will help to confirm that the information is factually correct and complete by providingan opportunity for review and modification, if necessary, this step can also help gain employees'acceptance of job analysis data, as well as the documents derived from this data and subsequentdecisions reached.Step Six: Develop a job description and job specification.82)Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the observation method versus the questionnaire method incollecting job analysis information.Answer:Direct observation is mostly useful when jobs consist mainly of observable physical activities, e.g., anassembly line worker. Third parties are used to conduct observations. This gives more credibility to thedata gathered through observations, unlike using job incumbents who may have reasons for distortinginformation. It's more focused on reality rather than on perceptions, since observations are done whilethe incumbent is performing the job. However, this method is not useful if the job entails a lot of mentalactivity which cannot be observed. It is also not useful if the employee engages in key activities thatmight occur occasionally. Observation can also influence the behaviour of job incumbents.Thequestionnaire method requests employees to fill out questionnaires to describe their job-relatedduties and responsibilities. Questionnaires can be structured or unstructured. In a structuredquestionnaire, job incumbents and supervisors are asked questions about work performed using fixedresponses, whereas unstructured questionnaires request incumbents and supervisors to write essays todescribe work performed. This method is relatively inexpensive and is very useful if covering largenumbers of employees or if the employees are scattered. Structured questionnaires can be easily analyzedusing the computer. However, developing and testing the questionnaires can be time consuming andcostly. It does not allow for probing and tends to focus on perceptions of the job. Responses depend onthe communication skills of the respondents.24\f"},rSCU:function(e,t,n){var i=n("H1Af"),r=n("8ouO");e.exports=function(e){return i(r(e))}},s6PA:function(e,t,n){"use strict";var
